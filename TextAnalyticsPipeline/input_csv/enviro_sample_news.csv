4feb6edc6edcf1a17b9a97ed7d06b543,Like a 'wheelie bin left in the hot sun': Queensland government launches legal action against garbage facility,"The Queensland government has launched legal action against a waste facility to stop it from carrying out odour-producing activities, after locals claimed it was making them sick.","The odour was like a ""wheelie bin left in the hot sun"". Sarah Waite had to close up her house and run the air conditioners to keep the place cool and stop the smell. ""It is a repulsive smell that you cannot get used to and it is difficult to persist with if you are outside,"" she said. Leonardo Monaco said the smell was so dire that it made him feel ""nauseous"" and it triggered headaches. ""If I had known about the unbreathable smell … I wouldn't have bought the house,"" he said. These are small sample of the more than 70 witness statements the Queensland government is using to try and stop a multi-million-dollar NuGrow garbage facility, south-west of Brisbane. against the Swanbank site, lodged on Friday by the Department of Environment and Science (DES) in the Planning and Environmental Court. If the application succeeds, DES will be able to limit certain aspects of NuGrow's operations, including receiving highly odorous waste that has ""a high potential to generate odour and impact the community"". Thousands of complaints have been made about a foul stench, often compared to cat urine and rotten eggs, coming from this industrial site. Infringement notices have been issued — but not about the smell. The department said it had gathered first-hand accounts from community members, detailing their experience of a noxious ""sweet fermented garbage"" smell coming from the site. ""Odour issues being experienced by the Ipswich community are unacceptable,"" a DES spokesperson said. ""This civil proceeding is the result of the department's enhanced compliance activities and meticulous investigation in the area, demonstrating our strong commitment to holding non-compliant operators to account."" Earlier this month, for breaching the Environmental Protection Act. Over the past five years, more than 25,000 complaints have been made to the state government about the odour across the Ipswich region. In 2018, the state government allocated $2.5 million to an Odour Abatement Taskforce to investigate the smell in response to community anger. In September this year, Queensland's Chief Health Officer John Gerrard said the region's air quality was ""below levels known to be associated with disease"" following growing calls for a public health inquiry. Others have called for a compensation scheme to be established for those seeking medical treatment in relation to the smell. ""When driving around our area, I am forced to keep the windows up on the car when the foul odour is present,"" Ms Waite, who lives in Flinders View, said in a statement provided to court. ""We experience the disgusting smell intermittently at my home a couple of times a week."" Locals claim the rotten egg-like smell is causing illnesses and ailments, including rashes, nausea, vomiting and migraines, with some needing hospital treatment. Kellie Bryan said the odour had a ""sweet tang"" that caused her to immediately start ""coughing and gagging and then vomiting"". She said the odour had increased in intensity in recent months and could last up to 12 hours at her Redbank Plains residence. ""The odour has absolutely affected me mentally and psychologically,"" she said. ""When the odour is at its worst stench, I instantly feel defeated, horribly sad, distressed, anxious."" George Baxter, who has lived at Flinders View for over 13 years, said he had stopped gardening due to the fumes. ""When we first moved here there was no bad odours … over the years, I have noticed that the smell is worse after it rains,"" he said. ""[It's a] combination of compost waste and dead animal."" NuGrow did not respond when asked for comment.",abc_net,2023-12-01 08:35:17.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-01/qld-government-legal-action-garbage-facility-bad-smells-swanbank/103179740

Amazon frogbit can be purchased online from producers within Australia and is promoted as an aquarium feature plant, despite being listed as prohibited matter in New South Wales. Tim Low from the Invasive Species Council said the ""choking water weed"" could multiply quickly and grow over an entire body of water. ""It acts like a blanket over water, dominating everything and reduces oxygen for fish and aquatic animals,"" he said. ""The plant's horizontal growth pattern helps it grow fast."" Mr Low said it could cause very ""dramatic"" and ""serious"" changes to an aquatic system, with the council ""afraid"" of its continued spread. ""Online trade has made it difficult to regulate the sales of frogbit, so people buy it for ponds unaware it's illegal,"" he said. ""There is not enough investment in weed control in any jurisdiction in Australia; the number of ornamental plants that are being brought into cultivation is staggering and everyone is worried about the capacity of budgets to keep up."" The weed was regulated as prohibited matter in NSW in 2015, with possession, movement and sale of the plant made illegal under the Biosecurity Act. Its first known naturalised discovery was near Forster on the Mid North Coast in 2017 and since then it has spread to the Greater Sydney, Hunter, South East, North Coast, Northern Tablelands, Central Tablelands and Western regions. In September and October two new detections were found on the South Coast at Bomaderry and Corrimal. Alicia Kaylock, Local Land Services weeds coordinator for the South East, said the biggest issue with the weed's spread was a lack of awareness. ""These kinds of things are often sold online as floating pond plants and [people] want to grow it in their fish tank and they don't know they are doing the wrong thing,"" she said. ""Part of what we are trying to do with these infestations is educate the public that this is not a species you should have, and if you do have it at home, please contact your local council and they can help you dispose of it safely."" Tony Martin from the Illawarra District Weeds Authority said illegal dumping was the main cause for frogbit's spread. ""People dump the weeds thinking it's plant matter and it can spread through floods,"" Mr Martin said. He said the weeds needed to be monitored for years after they were found and treated. ""The seeds can last up to three years,"" he said. The Department of Primary Industries recommends residents use the for information on frogbit and its identification. Studies into how long the weed can survive in ocean waters are being undertaken at Western Sydney University.

Pacific Island countries have been pressing Australia to sign up to the ""Port Vila call"" for a Just and Equitable Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific, saying it's a crucial step to avoid catastrophic environmental damage from climate change. Earlier this month Pacific Island leaders agreed to ""transition away from coal, oil and gas"", but Australia and New Zealand succeeded in watering down some language in the final Pacific Islands Forum communique, which says only that leaders ""aspire"" to the Port Vila call. The final statement also says the leaders acknowledged that the pathway to the phase out ""is not immediate nor is it one-size fits all"". Climate change ambassador Kristin Tilley said while Australia ""absolutely"" backed several elements of the Port Vila call, there were ""some parts of it that we're not in a position to currently support"". ""It's not … that we're saying, 'No that's it, end of story, end of conversation,'"" she told the A Little Less Conversation climate podcast, which is produced by the Australian Council for International Development and the World Wildlife Fund. ""But these are complex, difficult issues around the urgent phase out of fossil fuels, and in particular, fossil fuel supply."" Australia remains one of the world's major fossil fuel producers, with a recent paper by the Climate Council finding it exports nearly three times as much fossil fuels as the United Arab Emirates, which is about to host the COP climate talks in Dubai this week. Ms Tilley said that while Australia was intent on rapidly accelerating the shift to renewables in its own economy, it could not simply cut off supplies of coal and gas to countries like Japan and South Korea without endangering their ""vitally important"" energy security. But she told the podcast that Australia's fossil fuel exports to those countries would inevitably fall as their governments shifted to renewable energy sources in line with their own net zero targets. ""The strongest levers that can accelerate that shift from switching the supply of fossil fuels that we send overseas to becoming renewable energies will be the decarbonisation pathways of the countries that import those fossil fuels, and that use them,"" she said. ""[And] while it requires actions by those countries that are importing or buying our fossil fuels, we are working with them … through our bilateral energy trade to both decarbonise the supply of our energy commodities to them, and [on] their own domestic decarbonisation."" The ambassador said Australia also needed to understand ""decarbonisation pathways"" in countries like Japan and South Korea to get ""clarity"" on how they would shift its own energy exports. But the ambassador's comments have been criticised by climate change advocates, including those behind the push for a fossil fuels phase out. ""The Australian government is using a drug dealers defence to try blame other countries for their approvals of new coal and gas projects — saying they'll keep exporting their product as long as there is a buyer,"" said the campaign director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, Michael Poland. And Dr Wesley Morgan, senior researcher at the Climate Council said Australia could not avoid the hard realities of climate change. ""The science is unequivocal: any new fossil fuel project threatens our global climate target of limiting warming to 1.5°C,"" he said. ""Australia needs to stop adding fuel to the fire. That means stopping the approval of new coal, oil and gas projects, and getting behind a global commitment to the managed phaseout of fossil fuels."" It comes as Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen prepares to travel , where small island states are vowing to ramp up pressure on major emitters to keep key climate goals within grasp. Australia wants to co-host the 2026 COP meeting with Pacific Island nations, but is vying for the slot with Türkiye, which has also put up its hand for the event. However, the 2026 host is unlikely to be selected or announced in Dubai, in part because of a deadlock over which European country should host COP next year. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a new pact with the low-lying island country of Tuvalu, allowing residents facing displacement from climate change the ability to resettle in Australia. Ms Tilley said that Australia was still engaged in negotiations with a host of countries to see if it could lock down the event in 2026. ""This is quite interesting, because ministers say – well, what's the process to resolve this, and, indeed, there isn't a formal process,"" she said. ""We do have a competing country, so we are just working through the process on how we come to an agreeable outcome."" But she stressed that if Australia did win hosting rights, then the event would be held in ""genuine partnership"" with Pacific Island nations. ""Without question, we want this to … look and feel like a Pacific COP, so that international people who come say, 'Wow! I got the sense of Pacific perspectives that I didn't previously have,'"" she said.",abc_net,2023-11-30 03:44:34.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-30/climate-change-ambassadors-comments-pacific-fossil-fuels/103168048
7a16f47c4a2c9ad82329c19b9d1f9e7d,Reggie wants to see change for his community. He hopes an underground toxic waste storage facility will help,"The ""globally significant"" project will store up to 400,000 tonnes per annum of toxic waste, including low-level radioactive material from Australia and overseas.","Native title holders have voted to support the construction of a controversial toxic waste storage facility about 120km south of Alice Springs after 12 years of consultation. Developers Tellus Holdings said the Chandler Project would be the first underground salt mine and deep geological waste repository of its kind in Australia. The proposed facility will be built within a 500-million-year-old salt bed on Maryvale Station, 25 kilometres south-west of the remote Aboriginal community of Titjikala. The project has been given approval to receive up to 400,000 tonnes per annum of hazardous material over 25 years, from both Australia and ""strategic Pacific partners"" overseas. This would include low-level radioactive waste and naturally occurring radioactive materials. Tellus said the waste would be stored in an underground vault, about 850 metres below the surface, within the vast salt bed. ""The scale of this project is unlike anything else being built in the world, particularly how remote it is,"" chief executive Nate Smith said. ""The unique part about Chandler is the geology. It has an extremely deep, stable, thick bed of salt, which is perfect to create that scientific natural halt to make sure that waste is permanently isolated."" Last week, native title holders gathered to vote in favour of the project, with many hoping it would bring a much-needed economic boost to their communities. ""Some of the older people think it's dangerous. But I think it would be better to go ahead,"" native title holder Reggie Kenny said. ""The salt, nothing's going to come out of it once they put it in there."" Mr Smith said the low-level radioactive material would include medical waste, X-ray imaging and cancer treatment, as well as rare earths processing and water treatments. ""It's in hospital basements, it's sitting on the sides of curbs, it's sitting in on remediated mine sites,"" he said. ""The question is, does it continue to sit in places where it can harm waterways in the community? Or does it go to truly one of the safest places on the planet?"" While Tellus would not confirm a dollar figure, Mr Smith said the construction of Chandler would likely be up to ""10 times"" the cost of Sandy Ridge, an open-cut mine and hazardous waste storage site developed by Tellus in WA. He said this made it essential for the Chandler facility to accept waste from overseas, as there was ""no way"" the domestic market could support the cost. Despite widespread support, some native title holders, like Titjikala resident Elaine Shilling, were concerned the facility could impact local water sources. ""Not good, it's going to affect us, all of us,"" she said. ""We're just worried about water because we've got a lot of kids, a new generation. I don't know what's going to happen."" But Mr Smith claimed there was nothing to worry about, as the vault would sit about 500m beneath the lowest known aquifer. Tellus is also required to provide the EPA with an independent, peer-reviewed water management plan before any approval or decisions are made on the project. However, Australian Conservation Foundation nuclear analyst Dave Sweeney said the project had ""serious implications"" and required ""a high level of scrutiny and testing"". ""Low-level waste does not necessarily mean low-level risk,"" he said. ""Some low-level waste has short activity and danger periods but some requires isolation from people and the wider environment for 300 years."" Mr Sweeney said he was concerned about the ""potential for future project creep and the extension of materials deemed acceptable"" at any future facility after the Chandler Project. For more than a decade, the Central Land Council (CLC) has been facilitating consultation between Tellus and native title holders about the Chandler Project. CLC chief executive and Arrernte man Les Turner said the project was initially proposed solely as a salt mine but had gradually changed over the years. ""We commissioned independent advice on the radioactive waste component, and a lot of that's been provided to the native title holders ... and overall, the authorisation was provided,"" he said. As Maryvale Station is a pastoral lease, native title holders do not have veto rights, only the right to consultation. But Tellus claimed if native title holders had not given approval, the project would not have gone ahead. Mr Smith said, from here, Tellus would work to ""build trust"" with the broader Alice Springs community, and start approaching potential clients. He said, from there, construction could take up to five years and would aim to drive jobs in the NT for ""the next 100 years"". Many native title holders like Mr Kenny hoped the project would have lasting impacts for local Aboriginal communities. ""This mob here has given us the time to think and do everything. That's what we want and they want,"" he said. ""We want it to go ahead.""",abc_net,2023-11-03 21:16:44.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-04/native-title-holders-support-toxic-waste-facility-alice-springs/103048570
49eefb865d2495e13f21f44c0089071a,Inquiry seeks tighter leash on state-run projects for Basin Plan bill,"As the federal government's proposed changes head to debate in the Senate, a committee has backed the use of buybacks to meet recovery targets, and called for more scrutiny of water-saving projects, and greater First Nations involvement.","A Senate inquiry into the federal government's proposed changes to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has supported the legislation but recommended amendments that boost the plan's transparency and accountability. Key points The bill extends the deadline for state-run projects that offset environmental water recovery from the basin's irrigators by using engineering works to deliver the same environmental outcomes, and allows more time to recover the additional 450 gigalitres of environmental water. It also gives the federal government more scope to purchase water directly from irrigators to meet the basin plan's water recovery targets. While the bill passed the lower house without amendments, the Senate Environment and Communications Committee report released this morning has recommended amendments that tighten the leash on how states manage the offset projects, and how the commonwealth will assist the communities it buys water from. The committee has also called for greater participation from First Nations groups living in the basin. The legislation, called the Water Amendment (Restoring Our Rivers) Bill, is due before the Senate by the end of the year, with the government requiring the support of either the Greens or Coalition senators to pass it. Under the current legislation, the $13 billion Murray-Darling Basin Plan requires its 2,750GL water recovery target met by the middle of next year, something the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and Productivity Commission warned was not possible. A part of that overall target, 605GL, was to be met through projects that deliver the same environmental outcomes as purchasing the water from irrigators. The projects were required to be completed by June 2024, however a number of them, equating to between 190GL and 315GL, are behind schedule or barely started. The federal government's legislation gives basin states until December 2026 to either finish the projects or come up with new projects. But the Senate committee's inquiry said the government should go further, demanding unviable projects be scrapped, and banning new projects from being added, something the Greens were calling for. ""Noting these significant risks, the committee is of the view that no new projects should be allowed to be proposed,"" the report says. The committee's report backs in the long-standing approach of the basin plan, to recover water toward the targets and see environmental benefits flow on from the river having more water. But a dissenting report from Coalition senators argues that enough water has already been recovered for the environment, and that greater environmental outcomes could be achieved by addressing individual problems like cold-water pollution downstream from dams, and installing more fish ladders across basin rivers. During a two-day hearing held last week, the committee heard evidence that previous voluntary sales of water from irrigators to the federal government had led to negative social and economic outcomes in basin communities. These included population decline, business downturn, school shutdowns and job losses in smaller regional irrigation communities. But the committee sided with submissions it received that said time to implement the plan was running out, and ""there was an urgent need to recover the agreed volumes of water for the environment"". While the inquiry report acknowledged water buybacks did affect communities, it ultimately supported the view that buybacks were a more cost-effective recovery tool than infrastructure projects. However the dissenting report from Coalition senators recommended keeping the existing 1,500GL cap on water buybacks, which has not been met, and excluding them as a tool for recovering the 450GL. Coalition senators also recommended keeping a socio-economic neutrality test on water recovery toward the 450GL, which requires governments to prove that the method they're using to recovery water has no negative impact on communities. The inquiry report differed in this view, by flipping the onus of proof onto to communities, recommending they demonstrate the extend to which water recovery has affected them in order to receive assistance funding from the federal government. Governments, legal experts, industry and environmental groups all called for more incorporation of First Nations values and interests in management of the basin's water resources. The report recommends including the principles set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the water act. The federal government has admitted it gave little notice to irrigation communities along the Murray River about information sessions this week on controversial water buybacks as part of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. First Nations groups have been highly critical of the lengthy rollout delay of a $40 million funding package, announced in 2018, which was supposed to ""allow [Indigenous Australians] to economically participate in water and ensure that they get not only economic, but also cultural outcomes"". So far, none of that funding has been spent, and its purchasing power has been degraded by the rising cost of water rights. The Senate committee says the federal government should ""consider additional funding"" for the program.",abc_net,2023-11-10 04:19:09.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2023-11-10/murray-darling-senate-inquiry-more-offset-project-scrutiny/103084420

The blaze began on Wednesday in the Gnangara Pine Plantation in the city's northern suburbs and quickly spread west, fanned by strong winds and extreme heat. Despite the best efforts of firefighters, . The majority of the destruction has been identified in the semi-rural suburb of Mariginiup, while residential areas in Tapping and Banksia Grove have also been hit. An emergency warning remains in place for parts of Jandabup, Melaleuca, Wanneroo and Mariginiup. Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) incident controller Scott Hares said early on Friday morning the fire remained uncontrolled and uncontained. ""There's been favourable conditions overnight due to the lighter winds and high humidity, which means we've been able to reduce some of the warning areas,"" he said. ""But it's important that community members stay alert and go to Emergency WA to check where those boundaries are because conditions can change anytime."" After back-to-back days of temperatures touching 40 degrees Celsius, Perth experienced a cool change overnight as it fell to 19C just before 4am on Friday. The city is expected to reach a maximum of 35C, but of greater concern to authorities is an expected change of wind direction from north-east to south-west. ""[This morning] is critical to our effort,"" Mr Hares said. ""We're going to really work hard to consolidate containment lines in advance of that wind change."" With the evacuation centre at Quinns Rocks at capacity, authorities late yesterday opted to open the Bullsbrook COVID quarantine centre. Mr Hares said 19 people spent the night at the facility, while more were likely to be sent there as the fire remained a threat. In addition to the emergency warning, a watch and act alert stands for Sinagra, Ashby, Tapping and Banksia Grove. Mr Hares said it was likely other properties had been lost, but the extent of the damage was yet to be fully identified. ""We've completed about 80 per cent of our rapid damage assessments and we're going to recommence them at first light,"" he said. ""To those that have lost their homes, your loss is felt very firmly by us. We stand with you in these difficult and stressful times."" More than 100 firefighters continue to battle the blaze across a front that now stretches for more than 50 kilometres. With approximately 1,850 hectares of land lost, aerial bombers will resume their efforts to stop the spread of the blaze at first light. Hundreds of other staff and volunteers are assisting the community and residents at the two evacuation centres in Bullsbrook and Quinns Rock. Power has been disrupted across a wide area, with poles and wires brought down throughout the fire zone. Western Power said more than 100 poles had been damaged, with the number set to rise once a full assessment can be completed. : 35C : 22C-39C : 22C-39C : 23C-34C : 20C-29C : 18C-29C : 19C-33C Visit , call DFES on 133 337, follow DFES on or listen to to stay up to date.",abc_net,2023-11-23 22:02:25.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-24/perth-bushfire-emergency-crews-spend-second-night-battling-blaze/103143928

The New South Wales Chief Scientist released a summary and recommendations about this year's mass death event in a report released on September 29. The report outlined short-term measures focused on maintaining water quality to reduce the likelihood of a repeat of March's catastrophe. Australia Institute water researcher Kate McBride says the government needs to act urgently. ""We're sort of in this horrible cycle of dead fish at the moment,"" she said. ""A lot of the Menindee community and people within the Darling-Baaka … more broadly, are asking, 'What now?' ""We know what's going wrong and we know what needs to be done, but we're not seeing any action on the ground."" Geoff Looney, who has spent decades fishing and photographing wildlife in Menindee, is worried what the dead fish found since March could mean for the future. ""[It's] not very good at all,"" he said. ""These are the biggest fish in the river and hopefully they would be the strongest … but they still seem to die."" His concerns are shared by many in the community, including Graeme McCrabb. ""At the moment it just seems to be business as usual … or a 'she'll be right, mate'-type attitude, and clearly it's not right,"" he said. ""The lack of genuine intent by those agencies on the ground to ascertain what's killing those cod is causing distress among the community."" But Mr McCrabb believes the recent advertisement for a new senior water implementation officer based in either Broken Hill or Kinchega could be a positive sign. ""It's certainly a big step forward in trying to improve engagement in the Far West,"" he said. A recent NSW Fisheries survey found only two juvenile Murray cod in the 128-kilometre stretch of river from Menindee to Pooncarie. Ms McBride said she would like to see water agencies investigate the issue. ""The Murray cod population within our river [has] absolutely collapsed,"" she said. ""If that isn't cause to protect every living cod in the Menindee weir pool right now, I don't know what is."" In a statement, NSW Water Minister Rose Jackson said she supported all the recommendations made in the Chief Scientist's report and was working to implement them. ""This includes exploring the option of temporary fish passages, rolling out more water-quality monitoring and data collection, doing fish surveys to inform relocation and carp removal and investigating cutting-edge technology which can re-oxygenate water,"" she said.

8b141c398e30f0f5efed36f81bd44815,Sacred Indigenous site ready to reopen after extensive bushfire restoration,A NSW cultural area crucial to the initiation of Indigenous boys on their journey to manhood is reopening years after sustaining bushfire damage.,"Sitting beneath a canopy of leaves and vines, Walbunja man Uncle Bunja Smith recalls seeing a baby goanna earlier that day. It brought him joy, not only because his own personal totem was a ""bumberung"" or a lizard, but because it was a sign of new life. His encounter was in the Biamanga Cultural Area, located between Bega and Narooma, which will finally reopen to the public tomorrow, nearly four years on from the Black Summer bushfires. ""To see a baby goanna filled me with hope,"" he said. ""It was as if the park was telling me, 'We're coming back'."" More than 85 per cent of the Biamanga National Park burnt in the 2019–20 bushfires, including the cultural area that features waters sacred to Yuin men. A planned reopening in September this year was pushed back due to repeated forecasts of high bushfire danger. There are calls for better education about Aboriginal cultural heritage sites after rock carvings dating back thousand of years were vandalised at separate sacred sites in NSW. Then the sparked on October 3 and spread to 7,295 hectares. Of that, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said 5,468 hectares impacted the Biamanga National Park, Bermaguee Nature Reserve and Murrah Flora Reserve. The Biamanga Cultural Area wasn't directly affected in the Coolagolite bushfire, but the site remained closed until staff felt comfortable knowing the fire ground was fully under control. It has raised questions among the Biamanga National Park board of management about how to manage national parks. ""It causes me to pause and worry about the next bushfire,"" Uncle Bunja said. ""How can we bushfire proof our park?"" The NSW NPWS said reserves, or parts of reserves, may be closed to the public when the fire danger posed a risk to the safety of visitors. The Biamanga Cultural Area is significant for its Indigenous history. ""This is where the last stage of initiation would take place,"" Uncle Bunja said. ""It's where young boys would be given lore and become men."" Up until the 1950s, Indigenous boys would travel from an area on the coastline known as Bunga, and learn lore along the way. At each stop where they learned more lore, they would add more ochre to their skin. When the boys arrived at the final main pool at Biamanga, they would wash off the ochre and emerge from the sacred waters as men. ""They come up out of the pool, cleansed and anew,"" Uncle Bunja said. ""They're no longer boys, they're now men, they're lore carriers, lore givers; the warriors of the Yuin people."" The reopening of the Biamanga Cultural Area has been highly anticipated among local Indigenous people and visitors. The Biamanga Board of Management and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service have been rebuilding walking paths, toilets, signage, picnic areas and a car park at the cultural area of the past three years. The site was considered dangerous after the Black Summer fires due to the risk of falling trees, which delayed immediate repairs. There were also hurdles in obtaining insurance and finding contractors, and the previous La Niña event also made it difficult for works to be done in wet weather. But the staff involved in the restoration works were committed to ensuring the local Indigenous people were involved in the restoration works, right down to the finishing touches. ""It's been an extensive and long restoration process,"" NPWS Eurobodalla area manager Jo Issaverdis said. ""We've got these beautiful, handcrafted seats along the walking track … and local staff have been repainting the Aboriginal art that was originally engraved into them. ""They were actually liaising with the people that originally painted them to make sure they were doing it right."" Although the reopening will be celebrated, the public will be discouraged from swimming in the sacred waters. The site, formerly known as Mumbulla Falls, had been used as a swimming area since European settlement in the 1800s. Information signs have been erected along the main walk providing information on the sacred nature of the site and the reason why visitors shouldn't swim in the waters. Publishing images of the main ""initiation"" pool has also been discouraged. Uncle Bunja said the temporary loss of access to the site after the fires created a ""traumatic effect"" on the community, but the reopening was a reminder of how far the park had come. ""Watching the park burn absolutely floored me,"" Uncle Bunja said.

An initial flood watch has been issued for the Mount Lofty Ranges, Mid North and Eyre Peninsula. The Bureau of Meteorology said a band of rainfall was likely to bring 30-50 millimetres overnight and into Saturday over the Mount Lofty Ranges. The State Emergency Service's Darren Halleday said crews were preparing for significant rain on Sunday, particularly around the Eyre Peninsula, where falls of 60-100mm have been forecast. ""We're doing some pre-planning in regards to what that means across that patch, in particular with a lot of people travelling,"" he said on Friday evening.

Now, six decades since its creation, one of the four famed bark petitions has finally been returned to Arnhem Land.","One of Australia’s most important sovereign documents from the fight for Aboriginal land rights has been returned to the people of Arnhem Land, after going “missing” in the Kimberley for decades. There were four bark petitions created in the 1960s, all sent to Canberra in protest of mining One of the petitions eventually ended up in a home in the Kimberley, where it hung for decades The petition has now finally been repatriated to Yirrkala in north-east Arnhem Land The bark petitions were in the 1960s to protest the encroachment of bauxite mining onto their land on the Gove Peninsula without consultation. The documents were landmark in their combination of traditional Yolŋu bark art and typed petitions to show that the 13 clans of the peninsula had never ceded their land, despite the arrival of mining. On Thursday, the petition was finally returned to the people of Yirrkala, in the remote NT, and was danced to a position of prominence in famed Arnhem Land gallery, Buku-Larnŋgay Mulka. Daughter of the petition's sole surviving signatory, Yananymul Mununggurr, described it as a ""lost treasure"" and said its return was ""very, very important for this community and for my people"". ""It's important as it demonstrates the power that the Yolŋu people, our forefathers, had when they did the bark petitions,"" Ms Mununggurr said. ""It's important for all the people to come together and reconcile in unity, and also to think back, way back to the 1960s, about how our forefathers came together as one, with one mind, one voice. ""The good fight is not over, you know, we are still fighting."" The clan elders of the 1960s were left repeatedly disappointed, as in spite of their protests – both through the bark petitions and a battle in the courtroom – . The bark petition repatriated to Yirrkala on Thursday is one of four created in the 1960s, which were all sent to politicians in Canberra, including then-prime minister Robert Menzies. Ms Mununggurr said those petitions which remain in Canberra are ""something that can remind our government, the government of the day"" about the ongoing fight of the Yolŋu people. ""Governments come in and out, all the time, new people they come and go,"" she said. ""It's a reminder for politicians that there is a voice in there. ""The voice of our forefathers from east Arnhem Land, Yirrkala, telling them that we are here, the Yolŋu people are here, and it's what they said for the future."" No members of either the federal or NT government attended Thursday's repatriation ceremony. The return of the fourth bark petition to Yirrkala came about after a ""eureka moment"" by La Trobe University history professor Clare Wright, who had been researching a book about the petitions. ""I'd been writing this story and along the journey, I was able to locate this fourth petition, which has been missing to the Yolŋu people for 60 years,"" Professor Wright said. The petition had been gifted to the former secretary for the council of Aboriginal advancement, Stan Davey, and for many years it had hung on his wife's wall in the far north of Western Australia. ""As a gift to Stan for his commitment to the Yolŋu people, he was given one of these petitions, it hung on his wall, and then his wife's wall when they separated,"" she said. ""She took it around Australia … and eventually to the Kimberley, where she made her home. ""And that's where I found the petition, in the Kimberley, in Derby. ""She doesn't call it the missing bark petition, because she knew where it was all the time."" Rirratjiŋu clan elder Witiyana Marika said his family had been awaiting the return of the petition for decades and thought it had been forever lost to the world. ""It is a testament to the elders, their wisdom and insights into Yolŋu affairs, and we are very happy that one of the bark petitions has come back home,"" he said. Six decades on, the Yolŋu are continuing to fight against the arrival of mining onto their land without consultation through the courts, however, the Commonwealth is now challenging their claim.

Overnight, up to 50 millimetres of rain fell across the region — enough to significantly quell the Gunpowder/Yelvertoft blaze, emergency services said. Firefighters and property owners had been battling the blaze, which had torn through more than 200,000 hectares of rural land and sparked two evacuations of the Lady Annie mine. ""[The fire] has been relentless, it hasn't given us a break … the rain has helped massively. It's a huge relief, a miracle,"" Jake Curr at Yelvertoft Station said. He said the lightning from the storm that had travelled across the region had property owners concerned. ""Lightning strikes came down yesterday afternoon after we thought we had the fire under control, and it actually started another one, and we were feeling like we wouldn't get on top of this,"" he said. ""But the rain came and it was a godsend. ""We think this has put the bulk of the fires out — at the very least it's slowed them down."" The downpour was good news for firefighters who could now focus on containment operations, Rural Fire Service area director Shane Hopton said. ""This has definitely assisted … it will allow crews and landowners a bit of time to breathe after battling these blazes for weeks,"" he said. But they aren't out of the woods yet. ""Unfortunately it's not enough to lift the fire ban. The rainfall was very localised and some fires are still burning in the north-west, but not to the ferocity we've seen in the past few weeks,"" Mr Hopton said. ""We're very mindful that even though there has been rain, it doesn't ease the fire risk significantly. We don't want to give a false sense of security.""

ee4b035ecb080f8237b789f2b66dcf3d,Everything you need to know about WA's proposed new environmental approval laws,"Premier Roger Cook says the environmental approvals process in WA is ""broken"", but will his government's legislation to overhaul it create a free-for-all for resources companies?","According to Premier Roger Cook, the environmental approvals process in WA is ""broken"", so his government will legislate an overhaul of how the Environmental Protection Authority functions. The reforms were announced at a business breakfast this week and were widely welcomed by the mining industry and business sector but have raised concerns among environmental groups. The Environmental Protection Authority is supposed to look at proposals for developments in WA, such as mining projects or infrastructure like ports, railways and pipelines. Its job is to examine whether the project could hurt the environment and how badly. Once it knows enough, the EPA passes the information on to the government and provides independent advice regarding the potential environmental impacts. But it is ultimately up to the government whether it follows that advice or not after weighing up other considerations, such as the economic and social impacts of the proposals. According to the government and business sector, the EPA is moving far too slowly with assessments and is scaring off potential investors, including for projects that could help the environment. Lodging objections to permits for mining activities is currently free in Western Australia, but the state government says it needs more resources and funding to meet an increase in challenges. Delivering a speech at that breakfast, Mr Cook said industry had been crying out for change. ""Economic opportunity is being placed at risk by a process that has lost touch with the realities of doing business and protecting the environment,"" he said. ""Our approvals processes were once considered the best in the world but as the scale, the complexity, and then the volume of projects has increased, our processes have not kept pace. ""We have a situation where projects that could make a difference to the world's efforts to decarbonise are getting held back. ""It's a bitter irony that our environmental assessment process is now perceived as the biggest barrier to our ambition to becoming a renewable energy powerhouse."" According to the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry, there is up to $318 billion dollars worth of potential investment for projects in the state that are yet to receive environmental approval. Earlier this year Mr Cook ordered a short review of the EPA that found approvals processes had become ""overly complex, time-consuming, and costly"". The report itself has not been made publicly available but 39 recommendations to come from it have and the government says these recommendations have informed its planned overhaul. Mark McGowan will not endorse the Environmental Protection Authority's new carbon emissions guidelines, saying they go too far and could damage WA's economy. It is broadly accepted the EPA has faced a large workload with limited resources. The premier said this had created bottlenecks which had been made worse because there were a growing number of proposals coming in that were increasingly complex. To address bottlenecks, the government has set aside $18 million to fund the rapid deployment of additional resources for ""critical approvals"", including the use of external consultants and technical experts. That $18 million will also support the creation of a new role within the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation that will be given the title ""Co-ordinator General"". The co-ordinator general will report regularly to cabinet and will be tasked with making sure ""priority projects"" run smoothly. The EPA board is also set to be expanded from five members to between seven and nine members. And an EPA office space in the CBD will be established to bring it physically closer to stakeholders than its existing Joondalup base. WA's environment minister, Reece Whitby, will be given discretion to designate a proposal as carrying ""state significance"". For those projects, the minister will have the power to direct the EPA to complete its assessment within a specified time frame. ""This is intended for projects or proposals of state significance, the sort of game-changing projects that we don't want to lose to other states or our international competitors due to regulatory burden, the sort of projects that can create thousands of jobs,"" Mr Cook said. The premier said the new legislation will also allow other types of government assessments and approvals to run at the same time as an environmental assessment rather than waiting for the EPA. The government wants to make sure the EPA is very aware of the state's priorities. Built into planned changes to the Environmental Protection Act 1986 will be a requirement for the Environment Minister to issue the EPA with a ""statement of intent"", recognising the government's priorities and policies. We are yet to see what exactly a statement of intent would look like and what exactly the government's priorities for the EPA could be. But environmental groups, the Greens and one former chair of the EPA have raised concerns about the impact it could have on the authority's independence. Dr Tom Hatton was chair of the EPA from 2014 to 2020 and said it was always useful for the EPA board to be in tune with the minister of the day's thinking, but a statement of intent risked going too far. ""It seems to be in tension with parts of the act that say, for instance, 'The minister shall not direct the Chairman',"" he said. ""It could be very, very challenging, particularly in public perception of the independence of the EPA. ""Even if the EPA maintains its independence and maintains its integrity of advice, there's still that undercurrent, perhaps fair or unfair, that they've been compromised."" In September, Dr Hatton revealed he had felt pressured over emissions policy in 2019 during a phone call from then-premier Mark McGowan. WA's former environmental protection boss reveals how a phone call from Mark McGowan led to the removal tough new emissions guidelines, a decision experts say will be responsible for hundreds of millions of tonnes of additional greenhouse gases. The former chair said he feared the new reforms, especially the statement of intent, risked normalising such interactions. But current environment minister Reece Whitby dismissed suggestions there could be conflicts of interest arising from the statement of intent. ""The EPA is about providing independent evidence, but it's not independent of government, it has to appreciate the priorities and the issues that the government wants to confront and needs to confront,"" he said. ""The EPA will continue to have its independence in giving independent advice, but it'll be very aware of what the state's priorities are and what it has to make sure it delivers a decision on within a timely manner."" Mr Cook said his government would also be focused on putting a stop to environmental ""lawfare"". The premier said environmentalists were increasingly and frustratingly using legislation and appeals processes to slow down new developments and tie up proponents in court. ""Appeals exist to fix errors in the decision-making process, it is not another avenue for stakeholders to re-prosecute their ideological opposition to a project,"" Mr Cook said. ""I think most would agree that an international backpacker travelling through Exmouth shouldn't be able to appeal a proposal in the Pilbara and hold up an assessment."" Mr Cook also said he believed there was evidence of environmental groups creating division in some Aboriginal communities by influencing minority factions to challenge approval processes. ""I think it's important for all of us when we engage with Aboriginal groups, that we respect their right for self-determination, that we don't seek to find outliers that can then enhance your particular position."" Mr Cook said legislating its environmental approvals overhaul would be a priority and he hoped it would be introduced to parliament in the first half of 2024. Meanwhile, another major environmental endeavour of the state government, the ""Sectoral Emissions Reduction Strategy for Western Australia"", was also published this week. Greens MP Brad Pettitt said he was not surprised the SERS received notably less fanfare. ""The only target that's even mentioned in this document is one for 2050, when everyone in this government will be retired and no one will be accountable,"" Dr Pettitt said.

However, there's another climate driver that will bring some serious summer heat.","A scorching severe weather season is tipped for Western Australia, with a warm and dry summer expected that the bureau warns could be among the hottest on record. While many parts of the country's east have already seen severe bushfires and extreme temperatures due to El Niño, another climate factor is dominating the weather pattern in the west. The main driver behind WA's outlook is a (IOD) that developed during the past few months. Cold waters off Indonesia and warm waters off the Horn of Africa are creating a classic positive IOD pattern, which suppresses rainfall for WA and increases temperatures. The other weather phenomenon at play is El Niño, which occurs when sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become substantially warmer than average, causing a shift in atmospheric circulation. It was Peruvian fishermen, hundreds of years ago, who first noticed and named El Niño. Little did they realise they had named one of the most consequential climate drivers on Earth. This is how it works. Because El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean, the impact from this phenomenon will be greatest on the east coast. Its devastating effects have already been seen, as dozens of bushfires rage in parts of Queensland and New South Wales amid a warmer than usual spring. When a positive IOD and an El Niño occur together, they enhance each other and their drying effect typically becomes stronger and more widespread across Australia. For Western Australia, it means a warmer and drier outlook this summer, an extension of the bushfire season, a higher risk of heatwaves, a delay to the wet season in the state's north and fewer cyclones. WA Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Jessica Lingard said those living in the north would be at greatest risk. ""With the delayed onset to both the monsoon and those wet season rains, it's going to be more dangerous through there with the prolonged bushfire season,"" she said. Ms Lingard warned that while there would be fewer cyclones, it did not mean they would be less destructive. ""The average for WA is around five cyclones a year, so we're probably likely to see less than that number this year,"" she said. ""But we only need one cyclone to come through and we'll see those devastating floods like we saw in January this year with ex-tropical cyclone Ellie. ""If we have a look at last year, for example, [it] was quite a quiet season across the Australian region, we only had six tropical cyclones, five of those reached a category five cyclone, so very, very powerful systems."" Perth's summer is about three to four times more likely to be in the top 20 per cent of its hottest. The South West region, which usually sees slightly cooler temperatures, is also looking at being around two to three times more likely to have a warmer than normal season. The bureau's modelling also shows the chances of minimum temperatures being in the warmest-ever 20 per cent. Northern and central parts of the state are around four times more likely to have their warmest ever nights. ""In the north, we can see that's an issue because we've got the delayed onset of the monsoon, and we've got delayed onset of those summer rainfall, so much warmer conditions as a result of having that lack of rainfall,"" Ms Lingard said. A combination of very hot minimums and maximums will increase the risk of heatwaves. ""It really is the warm nights that drive those heatwave conditions because you can have a hot day, as long as you've got a nice cool night to recover from it. ""The body really struggles when we see those really warm nights consecutively, that's what tips us into heatwave conditions."" Most of the WA coastline will be very dry from December to January, as a result of the positive Indian Ocean Dipole and El Niño joining forces. ""In both of these phases, you can see the warmer water is further away from our country,"" Ms Lingard said. ""So taking with it, that warm water, the more evaporation, the cloud, the rainfall ... leaving Australia quite dry.""",abc_net,2023-10-31 21:14:39.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-01/el-nino-weather-pattern-in-wa/103032024

But there's more to the story.,"This week, CheckMate delivers some crucial context to claims that Labor's plan to reach net zero involves ""smashing the skulls of koalas with a hammer"". We also investigate a supposedly toxic new method to stop fruit from spoiling, linked to the philanthropist and frequent target of misinformation Bill Gates. Following a recent address in which Treasurer Jim Chalmers to reach Australia's renewable energy goals, the federal government has been accused of slaughtering koalas in its quest to achieve net zero emissions. On social media, grizzly claims took flight after Nationals MP Keith Pitt used to highlight the construction of a wind farm whose environmental plan includes provisions to euthanise the iconic animal where necessary. The Liberal Party suggested federal energy minister Chris Bowen was behind the plan with reading: ""Wind farms killing koalas: euthanasia will be conducted using blunt force trauma."" On X (formerly Twitter), United Australia Party national director Craig Kelly labelled the government ""a demented cult"" that believed it was saving the world by ""smashing the skulls of koalas with a hammer"". ""Labor's latest plan to reach Net Zero involves killing koalas that get in the way of their wind turbines, by hitting the koalas with a 'hard sharp blow to the base of the skull' to euthanise them,"" . So, what's going on? The Clarke Creek Wind Farm is a major renewables project being constructed north-west of Rockhampton, Queensland. It is being built in three stages, with the expected to add 194 wind turbines and power 680,000 homes. During his interview, Mr Pitt highlighted the project's , which notes that the project may result in the loss of up to 1,513 hectares of suitable koala habitat. The 125-page document details how the site's developers must protect threatened animals such as birds, koalas and greater gliders, and minimise or offset the destruction of habitats. Also included in the plan, which was drafted and approved before Squadron Energy acquired the farm in March 2022, are details of how euthanasia will be conducted in cases where injured animals are deemed to be ""unviable"". ""Euthanasia will be conducted using blunt force trauma,"" it states. ""This is a hard, sharp blow to the base of the back of the skull with a blunt metal or heavy wooden bar."" Importantly, despite criticisms of Labor's involvement, the project and its management plan were approved under the former Coalition government of Scott Morrison. As shown by the website of the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, the wind farm in November 2018, more than three years before Labor came to office in May 2022. Meanwhile, the project's 2023 notes that the biodiversity plan ""was submitted to the minister"" and approved on June 12, 2020. It says the latest version, dated September 10, 2021, was also provided to the then-minister. As for euthanasia, this is far from the developer's first option when dealing with koalas who ""get in the way"" of building wind turbines. According to the biodiversity plan, the project will build around threatened species habitat where possible (via ""micro-siting""), and its performance indicators include a target of ""no mortality or injury to … threatened species"". Animals must be identified via ""pre-clearance surveys"", and would be encouraged out of clearance zones through the use of ""sensitive clearing techniques"" such as tapping hollow-bearing trees, the plan states. Where a koala is identified, site developers must: avoid felling any trees that might fall near it; move clearance activities away from any koala that appears ""visibly distressed""; leave both a 30-metre ""buffer"" of vegetation around any tree housing a koala and a vegetation ""corridor"" to the nearest vegetated area; allow the koala to self-relocate; and not interfere with it unless it has been injured. ""Injured koalas are to be taken immediately to the nearest vet with wildlife capabilities or to an experienced koala carer and only handled by experienced personnel,"" the document adds. Finally, the plan states that any injuries will be assessed by a qualified ""fauna spotter"" who must seek advice from their supervisor or an experienced wildlife carer or vet before making any decision to euthanise. The guidelines in the euthanasia section of the document (D.6) can only be followed after section D.5, which contains rules on how to care for injured animals, including that: ""All animal care … must be undertaken in line with the Care of Sick, Injured or Orphaned Protected Animals in Queensland Code of Practice [2013]."" For fatal injuries, that animals should be euthanised ""by barbiturate overdose while under general anaesthesia"" or, where not practicable, by a method that causes minimal pain and suffering, such as ""cranial trauma"". In a , Squadron Energy said it has ""a zero-harm policy for native animals"" and employs wildlife officers to ""conduct assessments 24 hours before work starts and monitor and supervise work as it occurs, to prevent injury to fauna"". ""No koala has been injured or killed during construction of the Clarke Creek Wind Farm and clearing for stage one is 60 per cent complete."" In a statement, a spokeswoman for the federal environment department told CheckMate: ""The department has not received any notification of koala death or injuries from either the approval holder or any third party."" , an expert in koala habitat management and research fellow with the University of Queensland's School of Environment, told CheckMate that ""we shouldn't be planning for a catastrophic injury to any animals"" and that the euthanasia information was not ""a great look"". Dr Ellis emphasised that any euthanasia plan should state ""very clearly"" the competence of whoever was deciding on or administering euthanasia, and noted that the ""principles of adaptive management would suggest … [the plan] needs to follow the latest best practice"". Spanish firm BlueFloat Energy says it intends to resubmit its proposal for the controversial project off the Illawarra coast, which it lodged before the government declared the area designated for that purpose. In any event, the Clarke Creek project certainly isn't the first to include a euthanasia plan. Arrow Energy's 2018 for its Surat Gas Project, for example, noted that in cases where it may be ""necessary to euthanise an animal, humane procedures will be used"". While certainly less descriptive about the methods to be applied, the plan said: ""It is important to recognise that whilst some physical methods of euthanasia (e.g. stunning followed by exsanguinations) are not aesthetically pleasant, they may be humane as they ensure immediate insensitivity to pain. ""The choice of technique will be made based on the sensibilities of the animal to be euthanised rather than the sensitivities of the observer or personnel involved."" The blunt-force technique outlined in the Clarke Creek biodiversity management plan largely mirrors that contained in a published by the Western Australian government, titled Humane Killing of Animals under Field Conditions in Wildlife Management. Unfounded claims about a new spray-on product designed to prolong the shelf-life of fruit and vegetables have made their way into Australian Telegram channels, echoing scare campaigns advanced by social media users in the US. According to , Apeel Science, the invisible, edible glaze ""slows water loss and oxidation, the primary causes of spoilage"". On social media, however, the product, known as Edipeel, has been variously labelled as a ""toxic coating"" and ""Bill Gates' latest attempt to poison humanity"". Meanwhile, an Australian Telegram channel shared a post purporting to show a photo of an avocado labelled with an ""Apeel"" sticker, taken in a local supermarket. ""Poison APEEL now available at Woolworths 🤮,"" the caption read. But is it poisonous? Well, no. Claims about the spray being ""toxic"" appear to stem from social media posts and videos that point to a product safety sheet showing that ""Apeel"" contains chemicals that can cause eye damage and allergic skin reactions.

Specifically, it is made from ""the food additive mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids"", which in Australia is used in foods . by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) has estimated that, were Edipeel to be used in Australia, the additive would represent 0.6 per cent of the average Australian's ""mean total fat intake, which was within normal daily variation"". As for whether local avocados are already being sprayed with the product, the label pictured in the aforementioned Telegram photo refers to a ""California Avocado"". These are not available in Australian supermarkets, with recent analysis by industry peak body Avocados Australia showing that avocados are currently only imported . Apeel's website also shows that Edipeel . Meanwhile, such as InfoWars host Alex Jones have criticised the product due to the involvement of Bill Gates — who has at various times been accused of planning to or .

1ad9797fe8f11dfb857f18c68075be4d,'A classic example of greenwashing': UN climate summit website criticised over 'low carbon' toggle,"The COP28 summit reworks its website after a ""low carbon"" toggle is found to have little impact on its energy usage.","Organisers of the COP28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have reworked their event's official website following allegations of greenwashing over a ""low carbon"" toggle which was found to have a minor impact on the site's energy usage. The COP (Conference of the Parties) conference is arguably the world's largest intergovernmental gathering on climate change, and is organised by the United Nations (UN) but run by its host nation. The conference's 2023 event, COP28, is taking place in Dubai from late November. because of COP president Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber and the UAE's ties to the oil industry, but the summit website has also been criticised over a toggle which invites users to switch to a ""low carbon version"" of the site. The toggle's effectiveness has been criticised by experienced website developers who have accused COP28 organisers of greenwashing — a term referring to making misleading or false claims about the environmental sustainability of a product or service. ABC News initially found that when the ""low carbon"" toggle was switched on, did not display some of its images, but still downloaded all of them in the background — offering only a minuscule amount of energy saving. After being contacted by ABC News, COP28 organisers updated the event's website on October 26 so that it no longer downloaded or displayed any large images in ""low carbon"" mode, but an animation and a countdown at the top of the site remained. At the time of writing, first-time visitors still land on the regular version of the COP28 site, which downloads and renders all of its images. COP28 organisers did not respond to questions about the ""low carbon"" version of their site. The UN's climate change office the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), which has criticised greenwashing in the past, did not respond to a request for comment. Instructions: Use left and right arrow keys to control image transition Michelle Barker is a senior developer for an artificial intelligence company in the United Kingdom, and has written about COP28's ""low carbon"" toggle . She initially called the toggle ""fake"" and said it did ""absolutely nothing"". ""It simply gives the user the impression that they (and the website owners) are considering the planet, without actually changing anything,"" she wrote. ""A classic example of greenwashing."" Ms Barker said a low carbon site ""should be the default"" instead of giving users the option to switch to one, and said the language used by the COP28 website was problematic. ""The toggle label when low carbon mode is toggled on, 'Switch back to full experience,' makes it sound like users are missing out on something by switching on low carbon mode, when in fact (if done right) they could be gaining a better, faster experience,"" she said. Fershad Irani is a freelance web sustainability consultant in Taiwan who is part of the Green Web Foundation. He said he was excited when he first saw COP28's low-carbon toggle, but was disappointed by its implementation. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company CEO will lead this year's COP28 climate summit, raising concerns big industry is hijacking the global response to environmental challenges. ""At the moment, the way the low-carbon version is, it kind of does feel a bit like greenwashing, in that it's just so minimal effort,"" he said. ""It's just like, 'We removed images, and let's not think about anything else.' ""Whereas, if you're serious about this, you put some time, effort and design resources into creating an experience that is actually equivalent to what you would say the 'full experience' is. ""Which is why something like this, and the design of the low-carbon version, is super important."" COP28 organisers previously said that they aimed to ensure this year's event would be ""sustainable and carbon neutral"". In its Sustainability Policy, COP28 said its push for climate action and realistic goals would be ""reflected in everything we do at COP28 UAE, from the catering suppliers we use, to the transport options available to participants"". COP conference attendees have faced criticism in the past for . After the COP28 website was modified on October 26, Ms Barker said she was pleased to see the site was now using less data, but found the ""low carbon"" toggle still wasn't having much of an impact on energy usage. ""The home page is considerably smaller than before (in terms of data transfer) even with the low-carbon toggle off. That's good news on the whole, even though the toggle isn't having very much effect,"" she said. There were fears the 27th United Nations would end in total disaster. One big advance was made, but some experts are warning the hard work starts now, writes Michael Slezak. ""It's unfortunate that low-carbon mode isn't the default, and it doesn't seem like a lot of consideration has gone into the low-carbon design. It's still presented as an inferior experience to the end user. ""I actually think that's a really big deal, as there's so much stigma associated with making green choices. It's often spun by politicians and the media to mean reduced quality and going without. Whereas with careful design consideration, it could be a more desirable option, and there's space for high-profile websites to lead the way on this."" Mr Irani said changes to the COP28 website appeared to show it was now using less energy, but ""more needs to be done"". ""It shows they care, the fact that they made changes to the website … It shows that they are paying attention, and they are cognisant of it,"" he said. ""It's a good first step, but I understand the greenwashing criticism, because it looks like [the 'low-carbon' version] been slapped on there as an afterthought, rather than it being the primary reason for building the website and showing what you can do with using less energy and less data.

Maximum temperatures in the low to mid-40s are expected overnight with minimum temperatures in the mid-20s in the west Kimberley. The weather bureau says severe heatwave conditions will peak over the next few days, then ease over the weekend. The WA Department of Fire and Emergency Services said despite seasonal burning and mitigation the Kimberley region has been seeing a significant number of fires. In response to the extreme weather, the WA Country Health Service released a health alert for people to stay safe. ""Seek a place to keep cool, such as your home, a library, community centre, or shopping centre,"" the health service said. ""Severe heatwaves can be dangerous for many people, especially older people, babies, children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, people with medical conditions, and people who are unwell.""

Tapping into the knowledge of fellow Indigenous leaders is sparking hopes for their restoration.,"On Christina Gabriel's island home of Samoa there are still telltale signs of a catastrophic tsunami that engulfed its shores almost 15 years ago. Ms Gabriel remembers living on the eastern side of Upolu island when in September 2009 that hit Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga, killing almost 200 people and destroying villages. Beneath the ocean surface, where food sources are so crucial to her nation's way of life, recovery from the huge waves remains slow. ""The reefs were all washed out. There were completely no corals,"" Ms Gabriel said. ""We need assistance to replant and improve."" A long way from home, the community leader has been tapping into the knowledge of fellow Indigenous leaders from Australia and the Pacific in a cultural exchange in Bundaberg, north of Brisbane, aimed at conserving and improving the health of reefs across the Pacific. Australia has 16 Pacific island neighbours who are all on the frontline of climate change, which they declare is their single greatest existential threat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says coral reefs in the Pacific region are particularly vulnerable to a changing climate, disease, and human influence. It has prompted Pacific leaders to work together to combat those challenges and develop a reef monitoring network with the assistance of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). ""We need to improve because we hardly have the species that used to live in those areas,"" Ms Gabriel said. ""We want to get more food for our people in the future."" Papua New Guinea representative Naomi Longa is a co-director of the Sea Women of Melanesia, a group that trains women in PNG and Solomon Islands to help protect reef zones in their communities. ""We have a lot of challenges. Communities don't understand graphs and figures,"" Ms Longa said. As part of the monitoring network, a digital tool developed by AIMS called ReefCloud allows Pacific countries to share data on their coral reefs in real time which speeds up monitoring and conservation efforts. ""We can have a dashboard [and] use that to relay the information to the communities,"" Ms Longa said. ""The community can understand and know what's happening out on the reef."" Memories of the 2009 tsunami in Samoa has changed the way the whole community, and one resident in particular, thinks about natural disasters. AIMS scientist Yashika Nand said it was important to utilise traditional expertise in coral reef management. ""With climate change [there's] so much disturbance, like too many cyclones. Overfishing. There is a lot of land-based activities that are affecting the resources,"" Ms Nand said. AIMS principal research scientist Dr Manuel Gonzalez-Rivero said the workshops in Australia and the Pacific were leading to exciting developments. ""What we're trying to do is come up with recommendations about traditional knowledge — how do we manage that?"" he said. ""But also, how do we pair that with new technologies to help save the coral reef?"" Gidarjil Development Corporation ranger and Taribelang Bunda man Des Purcell sees the benefits of blending traditional knowledge with western science in reef projects around Queensland's Wide Bay. ""There's a lot of runoff in our area from local farming so we want to make sure that our water is healthy and our fish stocks are protected, [that] there's seagrass for our turtles and dugongs,"" he said. For local Gurang elder Lola Tiger the cultural exchange was yielding good results. ""Our little part of the world is in good hands,"" she said. ""The more we educate people, and the more people want to be educated, we will be in good hands.

f8d7dab465507583d5d986a2e0df92bd,Will your Christmas shopping be a gift to the environment?,"As Australians draw up their Christmas lists, more are choosing to shop online than ever before. But is it better for the environment to buy online or from a shop?","Research out of the US found traditional in-store shopping had twice the impact on the environment as online shopping. But Australian experts say online shopping loses ground when shoppers demand same-day delivery and when purchases are returned. November is the busiest month for online shopping deliveries for Australia Post as consumers prepare for Christmas. The year's biggest season for shopping has begun. The Australian Retailers Association is forecasting Christmas shoppers will spend almost $67 billion on presents, food and other purchases between the start of November and Christmas Eve. More people are shopping online than ever with 82 per cent — or 9.4 million households — ordering goods on the web in 2022, according to Australia Post's latest ecommerce industry report. November is Australia Post's busiest month for deliveries, with the postal service expecting 6 million households to make an online purchase in this month alone. In the report, Australia Post managing director Paul Graham said Australians had returned to physical shopping in ""strong numbers"" after pandemic restrictions. ""However, it's clear that the fundamental shifts in the way we live, work and shop that occurred during the pandemic are here to stay,"" he said. But have you ever wondered whether it's better for the environment to shop online or go to a store? Research out of the United States by the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics at Cambridge University concluded traditional in-store shopping generated twice the environmental impact as online shopping. It mainly came down to the emissions generated by individual shoppers using their private cars to get to and from stores as opposed to parcel delivery companies which use an optimised delivery process. The study also found maintaining a website generated significantly fewer emissions than the energy used in a physical retail store. ""This research might suggest that online shopping is the silver-bullet solution for the environmentally conscious consumer but online shopping doesn't come without its fair share of environmental problems,"" Macquarie Business School's chair of ethics Jana Bowden said. Online shopping can lose points when consumers demand same-day delivery. Professor Bowden said shoppers had become accustomed to what she described as the ""Veruca Salt 'I want it now' effect"". ""We are living in an era of the impatient shopper, conditioned in large part by retail giants like Amazon that offer expedited shipping options at the check-out,"" she said. ""Customers have become accustomed to getting their purchases delivered, not on time, but immediately."" She said same-day or express deliveries could have a greater environmental impact than a shopper going to a store to buy the same product. ""Delivery trucks may only be part full and couriers may dispatch a few items only to a local catchment area,"" she said. ""It's the dark side of online shopping."" Then, there are returns. Australian Consumer and Retail Studies (ACRS) researchers at Monash University looked into the way people were shopping and how often they were returning their purchases in 2022. ""Many might assume that if someone was to buy online versus a physical store, they'd be more likely to return an online purchase because they haven't been able to see it before, they haven't tried it on, they don't know the quality,"" the group's Eloise Zoppos said. ""Our research found the opposite."" Dr Zoppos said 66 per cent of shoppers who made a purchase at a physical store said they had made a return, compared to 42 per cent of online shoppers. Returns to bricks-and-mortar stores require further individual trips in private transportation, but Dr Zappos said online shopping also lost ground from failed purchases, particularly those that required air freight. She said returns also needed to be packaged. ""Some retailers try and make returns as easy as possible by providing a return label already with your product. But of course, that is more paper that is printed with the product,"" she said. Dr Zoppos said some retailers had starting charging a returns fee but she said it was not clear whether that was for sustainability or to help their bottom line. ACRS's research has revealed shoppers have become more mindful of their consumption. ""Particularly post-pandemic, when people really started to slow down and had time to consider the impact of their purchases,"" Dr Zoppos said. ""It is an important factor when deciding what to buy, how to buy, when to buy."" Consumer research by Australia Post last year found younger shoppers, in particular, were looking for more sustainable retail options such as recycled, reusable or biodegradable packaging. Retailers appear to be listening, with many starting to post sustainability statements on their website for customers to browse. Sydney-based online towel retailers Andres Fernandez and Andres Masso say sustainability can be a selling point. ""As a shopper, when you go to a regular, you know, typical store, you pretty much go and look at your product and you just buy what you like,"" Mr Fernandez said. ""You really don't have the time or the information available to look at what that store is actually doing in terms of the environment, the social responsibility. ""Whilst online, you have all that information available, you have the time to look around the website and see what that brand is doing."" Mr Fernandez said he had received positive feedback from customers about the business's online pledge. ""I think for online businesses it is super important to have that social and environmental commitment really visible on the website."" Professor Bowden said consumers played a large role in forcing retailers to adopt more sustainable products and practices. She suggested online shoppers choose regular shipping instead of same-day or express delivery, while those visiting a shopping centre or local shopping strip plan ahead to make multiple purchases on the same trip. Including the term ""near me"" when searching for an item can help reduce the distance delivery trucks have to travel. And you may even find what you're after is available at a store within walking distance to your home. ""If consumers continue to demand ultra-convenience, low prices, same-day shipping and prettily packaged goods, then that's what retailers will give them in order to meet those needs,"" Professor Bowden said. ""They can vote with their dollars, they can buy from ethical retailers, they can elect to purchase in ways that lessen their impact on the environment.""",abc_net,2023-11-11 20:10:44.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-12/online-christmas-shopping-environment-sustainability/102892212
00475ecdbf2391fd0396c64b53bee549,Excessive red tape and 'unmanaged' national parks blamed for Queensland bushfire devastation,"Sid Godwin says back-burning may have prevented a bushfire on his property where he lost 10,000 hectares of grazing land.","Queensland landholders are blaming excessive red tape and ""unmanaged"" national parks for recent bushfire devastation. Sid Godwin lost 10,000 hectares of prime grazing land when a fire raging through and razed everything in its path. ""It's your worst nightmare; we really had absolutely no chance at all,"" he said. ""I just call it a tsunami of fire."" before reaching Mr Godwin's place. The fire is now extinguished but it burned more than 160,000 hectares in the national park and devastated around a third of Mr Godwin's land. Mr Godwin said if he had been given permission to back-burn into the national park from his boundary, it would have limited the devastation. Back-burning is a technique used to suppress bushfires by burning the fuel load ahead of a fire front. He said he had requested permission from the Department of Environment and Science, which manages national parks, but was rejected and did not get support from Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) either. ""We were at the liberty or the mercy of the gods,"" he said. According to a QFES spokesperson, they worked with Mr Godwin on this decision. ""It has to be carefully considered to ensure [the back-burn] doesn't pose further risk to lives and properties,"" they said. A Department of Environment and Science (DES) spokesperson said QFES was the lead agency of the Carnarvon fire, and their staff did engage with landholders. Rural Fire Brigades Association Queensland manager Justin Choveaux said the state government had a reputation among landholders for being a ""bad neighbour"" and not managing their land adequately. ""The government is like any other landholder in the state of Queensland; you're responsible for your fuel loads,"" he said. Mr Choveaux said the government needed to work better with landholders to reduce fuel loads. The DES spokesperson said they have a ""good neighbour policy"" where they let neighbouring landholders know about planned burns and bushfires. ""[We] work all year round to establish and maintain positive relationships with neighbouring landholders to prepare for, and respond to, bushfire season,"" they said. Mr Godwin said in the past five years he had had minimal contact from the department. In the lead-up to the fire season, Mr Godwin had established fire breaks as a form of fire mitigation but said he did not conduct on his own property for fear it would end up in the ""unmanaged"" national park. ""It would possibly be our fire that could have created the devastation that we've now experienced,"" he said. ""That makes us liable and exposes us to prosecution and substantial fines."" A DES spokesperson said there had been 28 planned burns in Carnarvon National Park in the past five years. ""Our planned burn program has assisted with reducing the severity and spread of bushfires in the national park,"" they said. More than 350 kilometres north-east of Springsure, grazier David Wright is feeling similarly frustrated. In the summer of 2018, a quarter of his land went up in flames over six days. He and his wife helplessly watched koalas, kangaroos, and calves burn in the blaze. ""It was pretty traumatic at the time,"" Mr Wright said. After the Black Summer fires, he sought permission to put in a fire break on his state forest lease. He said it was a drawn-out process and DES required him to get a cultural survey done. In the end, it was too hard. ""I just ran out of steam,"" he said. ""It's so difficult to do practical things on the ground."" The DES spokesperson said cultural surveys were a legal requirement under the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003. They said they provided Mr Wright with the details for the appropriate cultural heritage body. Understanding the bushfire warning system could save your life. Mr Wright said he was also concerned about the consequences of doing planned burns to reduce fuel loads. ""You're that fearful of a fire getting away and damaging somebody else. You just aren't game to do it,"" he said. Rural Fire Service Queensland Superintendent James Haig said they issued a large number of permits for planned burns each year. ""They are free, and they're easy to apply for,"" he said. With rain falling on parts of central Queensland, Mr Godwin hoped his land would bounce back. ""It's rich black soil. One would hope it's going to handle it.""",abc_net,2023-11-25 20:14:58.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2023-11-26/red-tape-unmanaged-national-parks-blamed-for-qld-bushfires/103142334
076d872379760dfee0a248892640350b,"Algae is a biofuel option that can fuel you and your car, and could one day be a bowser choice","While you might recognise algae growing in your fish tank or floating on a lake, it can be transformed into a human food source that can also power your car, and it doesn't compete for space with crops.","It's the biofuel option that you and your car can use, and scientists hope it could soon be coming to a bowser near you. While you might recognise algae growing in your fish tank or floating on a lake, it can be transformed into a human food source that can also power your car. And unlike some other biofuels, growing algae doesn't compete for space with food crops. ""We see agricultural land being used to produce crops specifically for fuel – sugar-type crops or starch-producing crops,"" Queensland University of Technology biochemistry associate professor Mark Harrison said. ""That's food that could be going into people's mouths instead of fuel tanks."" While eating algae is becoming more popular, such as nori seaweed or algal oil in dietary supplements, Dr Harrison has no doubt algae will also feature at the fuel bowser. ""We will get to a point where you will go to your local petrol bowser and you will fill up your vehicle with biodiesel produced from algae,"" he said. With demand for fossils fuels including coal, oil and gas predicted to peak by the end of the decade, the International Energy Agency is asking countries to embrace clean energy technologies. The first step is to grow the algae. In an unassuming paddock next to a sugarcane mill in Queensland's Bundaberg region, the sickly sweet and slightly sour smell of crushing cane hangs heavily in the air. The site at Isis Central Sugar Mill, 300km north of Brisbane, will soon be home to ponds growing algae fed by the mill's wastewater. ""If it works out properly, we should be able to do it at a viable proposition so it assists the growers to be able to put biodiesel into their farm tractors,"" chief operating officer Craig Wood said. ""This will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that the whole industry uses in this area."" The term algae refers to a large group of photosynthetic organisms that use light, water and carbon dioxide to grow. Mr Wood said the mill would harvest the carbon dioxide created when the mill burnt fibre left over from crushing cane to make electricity and use the nutrients in the wastewater to feed the algae. Dr Harrison said using algae to filter wastewater had many positive flow-on effects. ""It potentially allows that water to be reused in a process within the facility,"" he said. Water that did run off would be cleaner, reducing the volume of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus reaching rivers and the ocean where they can cause harmful algae blooms. But Dr Harrison said scaling up to make algal production a viable business or diversification opportunity would be the biggest challenge. ""There's a lot of technical know-how … but the test is going to be how those processes perform through scale-up,"" he said. ""[The timelines] will primarily be driven, I think, by the capacity to reach sufficient scale where cost of production comes down to a point where it's competitive with existing fuels in the market."" Dr Harrison said it was part of decarbonising the transport system. ""The transformation of algae into biofuels and the integration of those biofuels into our existing liquid fuel network is one of those key opportunities,"" he said. ""It's not just about how the fuels are produced, it's also about the regulatory and policy environment surrounding that sector."" Back at the mill, Mr Wood is hopeful the ponds will be under construction by the end of the year. ""Hopefully by next crushing we'll have a good product coming out,"" he said. ""We've just got to make sure the feasibility is right, but all our prospects at the moment are looking towards it being a good, viable project."" Mr Wood said the mill may also look at using the algae as a human food source down the track. ""The chances of being able to do that are quite good,"" he said. ""It would be a good diversification for the algae so we're not sustained on one particular type of product. ""There is no reason why we couldn't go to proteins – that will help with food for everybody, everyone can be eating a green hamburger,"" he laughed.",abc_net,2023-11-13 00:11:04.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-13/sugar-mill-using-wastewater-to-grow-algae-for-biofuel-bundaberg/103083672

More than 20 years in the making, the 100-turbine wind farm planned for Robbins Island was spun off course in December last year by what proponents said was a ""completely unexpected"" decision from Tasmania's Environment Protection Authority, which approved the project on the condition it remained shut down for five months each year. That was to protect the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. There are an estimated 77 adult orange-bellied parrots left in the wild and Robbins Island sits in what is understood to be the bird's annual migration path between Victoria and Tasmania. The Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (TASCAT) on Monday handed down its on six separate appeals lodged by the proponents, environmental groups and community members. It dismissed five appeals by parties opposing the wind farm but upheld appeals by the proponent, energy company ACEN Australia. ""Our view is that condition FF6 [relating to shutting down the wind farm] is not proportionate to the risk and not reasonable or necessary,"" the tribunal decision read. ""The condition has the same effect as a refusal in the sense that the proposal will not proceed if it is required to shut down for five months per year."" A company wanting to build 100 wind turbines in the migratory path of a critically endangered bird species says climate change poses a greater risk to the birds than its turbine blades. ACEN Australia managing director David Pollington said he was ""very pleased"" at the news and said ACEN had been able to show that there was ""no evidence"" to support that the birds were actually using the area where the turbines would be located. ""This project … will really help Tassie reach its [renewable energy target], and provide cheap, renewable energy that enables development of other new industries in Tasmania,"" he said. However, the good news for the developers has left some of the remaining appellants ""gutted"" by what they say is a""disgusting, anti-environmental decision"". ""They should be ashamed of themselves. Every one of them … the evidence was before them. They've rejected it. That's on their own consciences,"" veteran environment campaigner Bob Brown said. ""This is a disastrous decision for Australia's rare and endangered wildlife."" Bob Brown Foundation campaigner Scott Jordan added that the birds would be ""slaughtered"" by the blades, which would be in ""the worst possible place"". The Circular Head Coastal Awareness Network, a community group formed in direct opposition to the wind farm, also made an appeal that was overturned. ""I'm extremely disappointed … the whole group will be gutted by this,"" network chair Steven Pilkington said. ""We'll wait for the legal advice and see whether we want to take it further.""

It has given the parties a schedule through until December 18 for any further submissions relating to the planning permit. The proposal will also need to be assessed at a federal level.

b4e42732b185ce21c54d5d183673bdf5,Thousands of plastic beads wash up on Sunshine Coast beaches days into turtle nesting season,"The local environmental group has described the spill as a ""pollution event of an industrial scale"".","An investigation is underway after thousands of polystyrene balls washed up on Sunshine Coast beaches just days into turtle nesting season. Hundreds of people have joined the clean-up and Sunshine Coast Council will continue to comb the sand with tractors over the coming days. The beads first began to appear at Maroochydore and Alexandra Headland on Friday afternoon and are suspected to have washed up from offshore. Alison Foley from environmental group Ten Little Pieces said it's a ""pollution event of an industrial scale"". She said the spill had come at the beginning of turtle season, and the small plastic beads were a danger to wildlife. ""It resembles fish eggs, and it's very easily ingested by turtles,"" Ms Foley said. Ms Foley said it was also a risk to shore birds and whales. Because the beads are light, they are hard to collect and spread easily. ""If we're seeing polystyrene here, it's likely that there's polystyrene going to be showing up in other environments, especially on the coastal strip,"" she said. The council's local disaster coordinator Bill Haddrill said it was a difficult clean up operation. ""It's not easy to to pick them all up,"" Mr Haddrill said. ""I think it might almost be impossible to get to the last one. ""We'll certainly continue our efforts until we collect the vast majority of the polystyrene balls that have washed up."" Mr Haddrill said authorities, including Maritime Safety Queensland, were working to identify the source and contain the spill. ""At this stage, we have no knowledge or even insights to what they might have come from,"" he said. ""It's a nuisance and a frustration.

6194bee59c1328c69610701922b779ff,Did three dolphins die because of an oil spill? The company says no. A worker says that's not true,"Three dead dolphins turn up in an oil spill. The energy company says it's got nothing to do with it, but Alex, an insider, sets out to prove it wrong. Now, an ABC investigation has revealed mistakes were made.","It's a hot Sunday morning on Varanus Island off the Pilbara coast, and there's a sickly sweet scent in the air. Workers are frantically trying to contain a leak that's released 25,000 litres of a light oil called condensate into the sea. Overhead, a helicopter tracks the spill. On the water, workers approach a grim sight — three dead dolphins floating upside down, their white bellies reflecting the brilliant morning sun. One is a calf. Staff member ""Alex"", who can't use his real name for fear of legal repercussions, recalls the moment he was told. ""It was quite a horrific thing for me,"" he says. ""I remember thinking, 'wow, I work somewhere that can kill dolphins'."" The company involved was Australian energy giant Santos, which operates Varanus Island as well as the surrounding oil platforms and gas fields. It will later reject that the dolphin deaths were connected to the spill. What really happened that day is still being investigated by a West Australian regulator 20 months later. A Background Briefing investigation, however, can reveal that mistakes were made during Santos' response to the spill. Alex, who went on to blow the whistle, is speaking out for the first time. He's convinced that Santos misled the public and sought to cover up the incident — a claim Santos denies. In the technical language of Santos' environmental documents, Varanus Island is surrounded by ""high species richness"". But for Alex, it's a place ""full of magic"". ""The greatest sunsets you've ever seen, full of all this marine life, all this bird life, beautiful lizards,"" he says. He spent his lunch breaks snorkelling through the pristine waters. ""For anyone who loves nature and the environment, this place was an absolute haven."" The island lies 75 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia, just west of Karratha. ""It was always quite weird to me going out there and being like, 'Wow, [there] is just this great big giant gas plant in one of the most beautiful places in the world,"" Alex says. Alex loved the environment, and the longer he worked in the fossil fuel extraction industry, the more conflicted he felt. In this special, six-part series, the Background Briefing team brings you the untold stories of ordinary Australians who helped bring some of the biggest and dirtiest scandals to light. Follow the full series here. In 2021, the International Energy Agency released a landmark report outlining how the world could get to net zero emissions by 2050. In that report it found there was no need for new investment in oil and gas fields beyond those already approved. Alex says he thought it would be a turning point for the company but from what he could see, it wasn't. ""I was very conflicted about being part of an organisation which was contributing possibly to the decline of the planet,"" he says. But that frustration would turn to anger in March 2022, on the day of the Varanus Island spill. In the hours that followed the spill, Santos employees traced its cause underwater to a torn hose carrying condensate onto a tanker floating around 4km offshore from the island. On the water, samples were being collected and regular updates were being sent to multiple government departments. At one point during the operation, Santos staff pulled up next to one of the dolphins — close enough to touch it. At 2pm, Santos notified the WA Department of Biodiversity about the dead dolphins. About an hour later, departmental officials asked Santos to collect the dolphins — which had been sighted 200m from the tanker. But when Santos workers went out again to look for them the carcasses couldn't be found. At first, the company said nothing about the dolphins publicly. Two weeks after the incident, Santos referred to it as a ""minor spill"" with a ""negligible"" impact on the environment. It was only eight months after the spill that a Santos spokesperson publicly acknowledged the dead dolphins, telling news website WA Today: ""These sightings were a couple of hours after the incident, in which time no harm would have resulted from this incident."" When Alex saw the statement he was shocked. He says the spill response was still in full swing when the dolphins were seen and he insists they were found amid the condensate. ""Until Santos' articles came out denying responsibility for the dolphin deaths, I'm fairly confident that everybody on the island, supervisors included, would have believed what happened that day had something to do with the deaths,"" he says. Another Santos worker told Background Briefing: ""Internally, it is believed and well understood the spill caused the death of the dolphins."" A US expert told the ABC it is possible a spill of this nature could kill a dolphin. Kathleen Colegrove, a clinical professor at the University of Illinois, has worked on a number of papers examining the impact of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill on dolphins. When asked if a 25,000-litre condensate spill could kill a dolphin, she said: ""Most certainly yes, based on what we know about oil spills and potential health effects."" The problem is, nobody knows for sure. A range of experts told the ABC the only way to answer the question is to conduct a post-mortem on the dolphins. One expert, referenced in Santos' own environmental documents, believes the bodies should have been collected. James Watson is a professor of conservation science at the University of Queensland and his work is cited in Santos' own Oil Pollution Emergency Plan. He told the ABC it would have been ""commonsense"" for the company to pick up the dolphins. ""If you found dead species in the oil, you need to make sure what the cause of death was,"" he says. Alex doesn't think the decision not to get the dolphins was a conspiracy. ""It's not that easy to pick a dolphin up and get it onto a boat in the middle of an oil spill,"" he says. ""I also believe that there was concern about where we were going to put a dolphin."" But he agrees the decision proved to be a mistake. He says it wasn't the only mistake in Santos' response. In this episode of The Whistleblowers, when three dead dolphins turn up in an oil spill, the company denies they had anything to do with it. It puts one employee on the warpath with Santos. In a statement later tabled in parliament by senator David Pocock, Alex accused the company of failing to get environmental monitors to Varanus Island fast enough. That criticism is supported by an internal Santos report seen by Background Briefing. It says a scientific monitoring team which was supposed to arrive within four days failed to reach Varanus Island until eight days after the spill. The report says the failure constitutes a breach of Santos' performance standards outlined in its own oil spill response plans for Varanus Island. ""They simply could not have known the real scale of the impact,"" Alex says. ""It was never checked."" Santos did not comment when asked about this but said in a statement: ""Results of environmental monitoring conducted on birds, other marine life, water and sediment after the event did not identify any impact."" Alex says concerns about the spill were raised internally at Santos but to no avail. His time working for Santos also made him distrustful of the key WA department investigating the spill — the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, known as DMIRS. ""To me, it seemed all a very self-report and accepted culture,"" Alex says. ""Santos self-reported, said, 'Yeah, look, this is what we did wrong. This is what we're going to do about it.' And the regulator goes, 'Yes. OK.'"" A number of current and former Santos staff and industry insiders told Background Briefing they didn't see DMIRS as a tough regulator. That view is also supported by a December 2022 review of DMIRS by WA's Office of the Auditor General. It found DMIRS is ""not fully effective"" at ensuring mining projects limit environmental harm. It also said the department's monitoring and enforcement ""does little to deter operators from breaching conditions"". A spokesperson for DMIRS said it accepted the report and has been implementing the recommendations. Its investigation into the spill is ongoing. The spokesperson added the department is taking the incident seriously and ""actively progressing its lines of enquiry and is speaking with relevant persons"". In the months after the spill, Alex didn't know what to do. He didn't trust the regulator. He didn't trust Santos. He wanted people to know what happened. ""There was essentially just no good option,"" he says. Frustrated, he prepared to take images and videos of the spill to independent federal senator David Pocock, alongside a statement in which he accused the company of a ""cover-up"". Alex hoped Pocock would tender the documents in parliament so they would become public. Doing it this way would mean Alex could remain anonymous and his statement could not be used against him in a possible court case. Alex decided this was his least-worst option. But while the risk was significantly lowered, it wasn't eliminated. Pocock had been an environmental campaigner before entering parliament. He'd also played international rugby for the Wallabies, a team currently sponsored by Santos. Pocock's staff vetted Alex and then invited him to Canberra to meet the senator. ""Sitting down in David's office I felt extremely out of place, pretty underdressed, a little bit overwhelmed,"" Alex recalls. The two of them began planning how to get the documents into the public realm. It was unclear if it was technically possible to have a video covered by parliamentary privilege. But once that was confirmed, Pocock faced a bigger hurdle. To have Alex's statement and the images covered by privilege, he needed to convince other senators to let him table the documents at a Senate estimates hearing. ""It was that balancing act of trying to give them enough information to deal with some of the concerns or fears about the political ramifications,"" Pocock says. ""But not give enough that you revealed the source before it's actually tabled and covered by privilege."" It was only after a last-minute, behind-closed-doors discussion between Pocock and the other committee members that he was given the green light to table the documents. Nearly a year after the oil spill, Alex's testimony, eight pictures, and two videos of the accident had finally been put on the public record. In the wake of the estimates hearing, international media picked up the story. Less than a week later, Santos released its annual report. It revealed the company had commissioned an investigation into the Varanus Island oil spill. It also revealed that, while the report was being prepared, executives would have part of their bonuses withheld. The company declined to provide a copy of the investigation, which is now completed, to the ABC. In a statement, it said the ""independent investigation did not support claims of a cover-up, and found the incident was appropriately reported and did not find evidence the condensate spill caused the death of the dolphins"". Santos said this was consistent with the findings of the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA). However, a spokesperson for DBCA said that without a dolphin carcass being recovered and tested, ""a cause of death was unable to be determined"". They added: ""Questions relating to the search for carcasses should be directed to Santos."" If Santos is prosecuted, it's unlikely to face a maximum fine of more than $10,000 per offence. A Freedom of Information request to DBCA, seeking documents submitted by Santos was declined. Among its reasons, it said handing over the documents might cause ""irreparable damage to [Santos's] reputation and market position"". In the wake of the documents being made public, Pocock received a letter from Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher. In the letter Gallagher concedes that Santos, in its public comments, used technical language ""which was not appropriate for use in public communications and insensitive to reasonable public concerns"". It was a very small win for Alex. More than a year and half after the spill, the company had walked back comments that initially provoked him to blow the whistle. Santos has not said whether it intends to pursue whistleblowers like Alex. It means there remains a risk his decision to blow the whistle could result in legal action. ""I am probably a little bit worried. I don't know what could happen,"" he says. ""[I've got] a little bit of a f*** you attitude to Santos as well to say, 'I think I've got a much better story than you do.' And I've tried to do everything right."" He hopes what he's done will encourage others to speak out. ""I'm sure that the Australian public would be on my side for just trying to tell the truth.""",abc_net,2023-11-03 19:21:17.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-04/the-santos-worker-who-blew-whistle-on-dead-dolphins-oil-spill/103056606

So how does the weather event work and how much of an issue is it expected to be during the significant bushfire season ahead? Senior meteorologist Steve Hadley from the Bureau of Meteorology said dry lightning occurred when there was no significant rainfall, particularly during ""overarching dry conditions"". ""Sometimes with not enough significant rainfall, of a few millimetres or more, that can mean lightning is essentially happening over drier areas and drier terrain with no rain to follow it up,"" he said. ""Then you can get some fires starting from that depending on how the landscape is at that time."" Mr Hadley said low humidity and cumulonimbus clouds — which electrify to produce lightning — were the main drivers of the weather phenomenon. ""With the lower humidity, closer to the ground, there's less chance of rainfall actually reaching the ground from those clouds that form and potentially then you can get the lightning occurring in those dry conditions,"" he said. The likelihood of dry lightning is high in the coming months. ""There is the risk we do see these hotter days with instability generating thunderstorms, so dry lightning could be a risk until we start to see higher rainfall amounts,"" Mr Hadley said. ""In some years we can get very dry years and not a lot of rainfall during the summer in some places, so potentially it could be a risk all summer."" Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) Acting Chief Superintendent Warren Buckley said dry lightning could cause significant issues for firefighters. ""When we have lightning hit the ground and we don't get the rain to put out that hotspot, the lightning [that has] created it can either ignite it straight away or it can fester overnight and come out the next day with significant fire growth,"" Mr Buckley said. ""We monitor where the storms go. We use the lightning trackers and we use eyes on the ground to give us the best idea of where we can place our resources for pending outbreaks."" Mr Buckley said people could take measures to protect themselves and their property against fires caused by dry lightning. ""Maintain your property and show you have an accurate bushfire plan,"" he said. ""Make sure that you've got your gutters clean and it's clean around the houses and your sheds. We lose a lot of houses that have grass growing up to sheds and underneath houses.""

North-West Rural Fire Service Area Director Shane Hopton said residents should act with caution. ""With conditions starting to dry out, it is quite simple for a hot vehicle, that has spinifex stuck to it, to ignite and start a serious fire,"" Mr Hopton said. Fuel loads were at a risky level across the region following a record wet season earlier in the year. ""It's imperative that people who are travelling pay close attention to where they're driving and parking when they pull over for a break,"" Mr Hopton said.

Leaders from countries in favour of a phase-out, including Australia’s Pacific neighbours, were left stunned when the draft text for COP28 omitted any mention of fossil fuels. There had been suggestions a deal was within reach amid efforts by a large bloc of countries to negotiate a breakthrough. But a draft document released following days of intense negotiations stopped short of that ambition. Rather, it set out a plan for ""reducing both the consumption and production of fossil fuels"". The document said such a reduction should be done in a ""just, orderly and equitable manner so as to achieve net zero (carbon emission) by, before, or around 2050 in keeping with the science"". It also called for action to ""accelerate efforts globally towards net zero emissions energy systems, using zero and low carbon fuels well before or by around mid-century"". If agreed by the almost 200 countries involved in the summit, the text would nevertheless be the first time a COP text referred to fossil fuels in such an explicit way. At a press conference in the wake of the release, summit president Sultan al-Jaber was hailing the draft as a significant strengthening of the global drive to cut emissions. Dr al-Jaber called on delegates to show ""even more flexibility"" as they entered the final days and hours of negotiations while acknowledging that ""gaps"" remain on many issues between countries. However, he insisted progress was being made. ""The world is watching,"" Dr al-Jaber said. ""Let's not rest until we get this done. ""Yes, we have made progress but we still have a lot to do. ""You know I want you to deliver the highest ambition on all items including on fossil fuel language."" Despite the upbeat tone, leaders of countries pushing for a phase-out were deeply unhappy about the draft text released overnight. Cedric Schuster, the Minister for Natural Resources and Environment in the Pacific Island nation of Samoa, was damning. He said the draft test went nowhere near far enough and would risk undermining efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. As a consequence, he said small island states like his own would be imperilled. ""If we do not have strong mitigation outcomes at this COP then this will be the COP where 1.5C would have died,"" Mr Schuster said. ""We will not sign our death certificates. ""We cannot sign on to text that does not have a strong commitment on phasing out fossil fuels. ""We have been asked throughout this process, what is at stake if these negotiations don't return a strong outcome that keeps 1.5C alive? ""How can you not understand it is our very survival that is at stake. ""This is why in every room our negotiators have been pushing tirelessly for decisions that align with staying under 1.5C of warming. ""That is why if parties continue to oppose the phase out of fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies they must stop and question their own commitment to this process.""",abc_net,2023-12-11 15:19:18.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-12/draft-cop28-text-omits-fossil-fuel-phase-out/103216494

a16cbd53c3159655e0e4a6e0aae29c91,Cummins claims criticism of his climate activism ’emboldened’ his views,Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins has claimed public criticism about his political views has helped to “embolden” his beliefs.,"As a vocal climate change activist Cummins has been criticised by some who believe he should remain apolitical whilst at the helm of the Australian cricket team. Cummins doubled down on his views when asked whether being called a “woke far left climate catastrophist clown” affected his dedication, in an interview on “It definitely makes you stop and think if what you're doing and how you're going about it is the right way,” Cummins said. “It either makes you change or if anything it probably has emboldened some of my views that this is a good thing. “You know, if I don't stay strong in this and I pander to a loud minority, that's not a good thing.” Cummins was praised by former Wallabies captain turned independent Senator David Pocock for being a “leader for our times” who should “give Australians a bit of extra pride”. Cummins humbly said it was not for him to say whether he was a “leader for the times” but accepted his views made him different to captains from the past. “I think that becoming an adult, you start forming how you see the world differently to maybe how you were as a kid and you start thinking for yourself,” Cummins said. “Maybe it's kind of more prevalent when you're a captain and you're more in the public eye but I don't think it's anything new. “I think there's always issues in the world. There always have been. It's just perhaps these issues and how they're dealt with a little differently to how they were 20, 30, 40 years ago.” For activism throughout his career Cummins has been dubbed “Captain Planet” and “Captain Woke”. The 30-year-old led Australia in taking a knee in support of Black Lives Matter during a series against the West Indies along with personally voicing support for the Voice to Parliament. Cummins also expressed shortly before the company decided not to renew its $40 million partnership. Both Cricket Australia and Alinta have insisted the discussions had no influence on the deal’s ending. Cummins also spearheaded the Cricket for Climate organisation which helps to get solar panels installed at local clubs around the country and is assisting cricket in becoming a carbon-neutral sport in Australia. Cummins was named as the first full-time fast bowling captain of the men’s Test team in November 2021 and last year was appointed to the ODI captaincy. At the time there was some scepticism about whether a fast bowler could manage full-time captaincy with team leaders almost always restricted to batters, wicketkeepers and all-rounders. The scepticism has been put to bed as he returned home from captaining Australia to its sixth Cricket World Cup title. The title caps off one of the most successful years of his career which included leading the team to a World Test Championship and Ashes retention in England. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese recently threw his support behind Cummins for overcoming the critics of his “woke” political views. “Patrick Cummins what a leader, someone who was criticised for being woke and there were articles in various publications calling upon him to be cast aside (as) you couldn’t be a bowler and captain the side,” the Prime Minister told Sky News Australia's Chief Anchor Kieran Gilbert.",skynewsau,2023-11-29 03:49:01.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/australian-captain-pat-cummins-doubles-down-on-climate-activism-and-claims-criticism-emboldened-his-political-views/news-story/a63f0aae4cfcdd07ba7d9222cb413b07

However, on Wednesday evening representatives announced a final communique would express a directive to ""transition away"" from fossil fuels, including oil and gas under COP's remit for the first time in its almost three decade history. Countries agreed to ""contribute to"" global efforts to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net-zero by 2050 in keeping with the science"", an outcome which has been broadly welcomed by all parties. United States climate envoy John Kerry hailed the outcome as ""a clarion call to all of us about our obligations and responsibilities to make sure we’re reaching as far as we can to implement as fast as we can."" ""This document sends very strong messages to the world,"" he said. While some nations with more progressive stances on climate change were understood to be disappointed not to secure a ""phasing out"" of fossil fuels, it is understood they were accepting of the final wording in absence of an agreeable alternative. Australia, meanwhile, was understood to have been a key backer of the ""transition"" wording, which mirrors a similar commitment agreed through last month's Pacific Islands Forum. On Monday, Mr Bowen had told media a strong wording was in the country's best interests as it would create an ""opportunity"" for Australia to realise its potential as a renewable energy powerhouse. The government had also been relying on an agreement to add further justification for its own domestic policies. One of which was the increased tax on some popular, large hybrid cars, such as the Mazda CX60 and Toyota Kluger, it announced as part of the mid-year Budget update on Wednesday. By tightening the definition of a fuel-efficient vehicle, the government will impose a new 33 per cent ""luxury"" car tax on a host of models in a move aimed at reducing the nation's greenhouse emissions. The change will see the threshold for the higher tax lowered from seven litres per 100km to just 3.5 and is expected to generate $155 million over two years once the policy kicks in from July 1, 2025. Industry groups have voiced concern, however, suggesting a tax on hybrid cars would send the wrong message to consumers and claiming the government is only introducing the change to increase its revenue.

56706ebdddb7c7eb1aadb622de558ece,Huge move to help volunteer fireys,"People in NSW will be able to support the state’s volunteer firefighters by recycling bottles, cans, and cartons through a new partnership.","From Monday until April 2024, people can choose to donate 10c per item deposited through the ‘Return and Earn’ to contribute to the RFS Benevolent Fund, which was established after the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires. The fund goes towards supporting NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) volunteers and their families, including members who were injured or fell ill during their service or the families of volunteers who died. To date the Return and Earn scheme has returned more than 10.4bn containers, and raised $47m for charities and not-for-profit organisations. NSW Environment Minister Penny Sharpe urged the community to get on board with the program “Not only does recycling through Return and Earn help the environment, but it can now also be a great way to give back to our volunteer firefighters who look after us during the bushfire season,” she said. “I encourage all householders to take their eligible cans and bottles to their local Return and Earn point and consider donating to worthy organisations including the new RFS Benevolent Fund.” NSW Emergency Services Minister Jihad Dib said the fund was a “vital step” in giving back to volunteers, especially as the state faces a brutal fire season. “We know that our volunteers give so much, protecting their communities and when called on, travelling long distances to support others in their time of need,” he said. “This is one way to show how much this is valued and ensure RFS members and their families have the support they need. “I encourage everyone who recycles to consider donating to the Fund to support those who keep our communities safe.” Former NSW Police Commissioner Ken Moroney has been appointed as the chair of the fund, which will also include Nancy Fox as deputy chair, Louise Meijer as treasurer and Elizabeth Svoboda, and Trevor Anderson as secretaries. Mr Moroney said it was an honour to “and contribute to the wellbeing of our brave firefighters”. “Their dedication is commendable, and it is our duty to ensure they and their families receive the compassionate support they need,” he said. “Community contributions, like those through the Return and Earn initiative, will allow the board to help those who need it most for years to come.” This year, two RFS volunteers have died while fighting fires. In October, Senior Deputy Captain John Holmes died as a result of a medical episode while battling a blaze in the Bean Creek Fire, north of Bonalbo. Just a month later, Captain Leo Fransen was killed by a fallen tree while fighting the Hudson fire near Walgett, in NSW’s north. He was the captain of the Diamond Beach rural fire brigade, and on a three-day deployment in Glengarry when the incident occurred.

Winds of up to 140km/h and heavy rainfall are forecast across parts of Queensland's north coast, with Sky News Weather Reporter Samantha Chiari explaining the conditions could become ""life threatening"" in some areas. ""We are expected to see destructive winds of up to 140km/h with this system and they will continue to strengthen as Jasper approaches the coast,"" she said. ""We are also watching for heavy rainfall. This could bring life threatening flash flooding, particularly between Cape Flattery and Port Douglas, where six hour totals are expected to be between 200 and 300mm."" According to the BOM, Cyclone Jasper could dump as much as 500mm of rain in just 24 hours and residents in storm surge areas are being told to consider evacuation. Senior BOM meteorologist Laura Boekel added that even though the storm was only a category two system, gale force winds could still cause significant damage. ""A category 2 system typically sees enough wind to bring up and down large trees and also move around large objects that have not been secured,"" she said. ""It's important to note too that gale force winds aren't just gusts of winds that happen occasionally, but they can be consistent and sustained winds, so very strong winds occurring at a very consistent rate."" However, the greatest danger is likely to be rising coastal waters, with Sky News Weather meteorologist Rob Sharpe explaining the threat on Tuesday. ""The most dangerous part of a tropical cyclone is historically the storm surge or the storm time as the ocean comes inland and rises upwards,"" he said. ""Now the storm tide has already been reaching heights of around 30 to 40cm above the typical tide heights. That does not cause any substantial issues so far, but the storm tide will be large on Wednesday. ""The water level is likely now to be the highest of the year for Cairns and Port Douglas and many of the surrounding regions; and in Cairns alone close to 15,000 homes lie within two metres of the highest astronomical tide of the year."" Mr Sharpe added that the waters were likely to hit their highest point about 9:30am on Wednesday and that locals should keep a close eye on tides due to the risk of widespread flooding. Residents are also being urged to avoid driving on roads flooded by the storm and to take care when travelling near the coast.",skynewsau,2023-12-12 11:17:57.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/weather/category-2-cyclone-jasper-to-hit-queensland-on-wednesday-with-tropical-storm-triggering-evacuation-warnings/news-story/54116ba1758751133a0c617fd48f714a

Angry motorists on their way to work could be heard repeatedly pressing the car horn, with at least one driver emerging and telling the group to move on.

He is also my friend,” he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. However, unlike Mr Andrews, the second striker is only refusing to eat until “political leaders” agree to meet with his friend, who has already surpassed 16 days with no food. In dramatic scenes, Mr Andrews was carted away by ambulance outside Parliament House on Friday after going without food for more than two weeks in protest of the Albanese government's fossil fuel subsidies. The activist was taken for precautionary checks about 11am after a passerby noticed he was suffering from shortness of breath, according to The Guardian. In addition to ceasing all fossil fuel subsidies, Mr Andrews’ demands include the complete phase out of coal and gas exports, stopping the logging of native forests, releasing the findings from the National Security Climate Risk Assessment report, and amending Australia’s Environment Protection Biodiversity Act to include climate impacts. His cause has drawn national attention, with the activist receiving visits from a range of Greens and independent politicians, including Senator David Pocock, teal MP Allegra Spender and Greens Senator David Shoebridge.

A car carrying five occupants, including the little boy, first attempted to cross through but was quickly swept away by the force of the waters. The male driver, 38, a woman and two other children were able to escape and cling to trees nearby, however, the five-year-old boy became trapped inside before the vehicle got sucked under. News of the incident did not become known until several hours later when a second car came along, entered the flood crossing and was also submerged. Its occupants were able to free themselves and found the four others still perched on trees, with emergency services then being alerted. During the large multi-agency search and rescue operation that followed the next day, police divers were able to locate the child’s body in the submerged car. An investigation into the tragedy ensued and on Thursday, more than 14 months later, NSW Police arrested the 38-year-old driver in Sydney and charged him with manslaughter, dangerous driving occasioning death-drive manner dangerous and negligent driving (occasioning death).

5c8ba9a8fd1fd2e1dc37f4aa86bff453,Inside the weather death data at the heart of the climate change debate,The world has seen temperatures briefly rise to as high as two degrees above pre-industrial temperatures for the first time ever.,"Hot weather is becoming more common than cold, but is that as bad as we are led to believe? The Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO both say that “extreme heat has caused more deaths in Australia than any other natural hazard.” Yet other leading scientists suggest it is cold that is more deadly for Australians. I’ve investigated the arguments and its importance in the climate change debate. in the Lancet a couple of years ago found that deaths during cold weather were much more common than heat-related deaths. In the 20 years from 2000 to 2019 they found that approximately 16,684 Australians died during cold spells compared to 2,640 in the heat. This is close to six times as many deaths related to cold weather as opposed to hot, with the heat findings . If you look at thing globally, the results are even more striking with close to nine times as many excess deaths during cold weather as opposed to hot. Meanwhile, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) have recently released a showing the impact of extreme weather events on human health. In this they found that heat was the biggest killer with almost 300 deaths in the decade to 2021. Cold was a little behind with just 242 deaths in ten years. One of the main reasons for the stark difference in the results is the way the numbers are counted. BoM, CSIRO and AIHW all focus on extreme weather events – only looking at small regions with extreme hot spells and cold spells and its direct impact on health. On the other hand, the Lancet study, and others like it, have a lower threshold for hot and cold weather that they term “non-optimal temperatures” and they look at “excess deaths”. Essentially, they include many more days for which heat and cold play a role in human health, and they look at all deaths rather than those specifically related to the weather. They are therefore showing something closer to the impact of the seasons on human health rather than extreme weather. In Australia we know that many of our illnesses are seasonal, such as influenza and the cold. The latest research also suggests that COVID follows a similar seasonal pattern. Professor Andrew Wilson from the Menzies centre told the ABC that ""the people who are most susceptible to deaths during these (cold) periods are the people who are most susceptible to deaths at other times; that is, people who have pre-existing diseases"". There is strong evidence that both sets of studies and organisations are accurate. Colder weather brings in the seasonal illnesses and the greatest number of excess deaths. At the same time extreme heatwaves are more deadly than extreme cold events. Globally, temperatures are rising at a rapid rate. 2023 is set to be named the hottest on record – close to 1.5C hotter than pre-industrial temperatures. Last week the world registered its first two days above 2C. As temperatures rise extreme heatwaves are becoming much more common, but cold weather is harder to find. Scientists are still debating whether the number of heat deaths will be offset by the decreasing cold deaths. Most studies suggest that heat deaths are rising faster than cold deaths are decreasing. However, many of these fail to account for the ability of humans to acclimatise to heat both physiologically and technologically (eg air conditioning). In a of the research, Patrick Brown from John Hopkins University suggests that increasing heat deaths will be mostly countered by decreasing cold deaths, but more research is needed. Over the past 20 years, the term “global warming” has become much less common than “climate change”. This is because the changes occurring on our planet are more complex than just some extra heat – and the human impact of the heat is smaller than many other factors. According to the almost half of the world experienced drought during the past decade compared to just 18 per cent during the 1950s. The Lancet also said that “heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981-2010, putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects”. It is widely believed that these problems will continue to get worse across much of the world as rainfall patterns change. The greatest impact on future generations is expected to be inevitable sea level rise. This year’s said that “in the Earth’s past, a 1.5C global temperature resulted in sea levels six-nine metres above today”. More than 400 million people live within five metres of the current sea level. Researchers believe that if temperatures continue to rise unabated, sea levels should rise to about one metre by 2100. Even a 2C rise in temperatures is forecast to eventually lead to sea levels of 12 to 18 metres – something that would put many cities and towns underwater in the centuries to come. There are a range of other global impacts from humanity’s experiment with the world’s climate, but these are two of the most pressing. The question for humanity is how we respond to the seemingly endless parade of research and warnings about our changing climate.",skynewsau,2023-12-02 19:00:00.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.skynews.com.au/insights-and-analysis/inside-the-cold-vs-hot-weather-death-statistics-at-the-heart-of-the-climate-change-debate-as-the-world-hits-new-warming-record/news-story/22bf42316e1eb1c5dba4afcba7709994

A broad area of the southeast falls within the weather target zone, including the Brisbane Metropolitan Area, Burketown, Beaudesert, Boonah, Caboolture, Caloundra, Doomadgee, Ipswich, Normanton, and Redcliffe. Queensland Health identified the high temperatures would not simply cause discomfort, but also pose serious risks of many heat-related illnesses to the community, as it urged people to be watchful for all symptoms. “Signs of heat stress can include rising body temperature, dry mouth and eyes, headache, shortness of breath or vomiting,” Chief Health Officer Dr John Gerrard said. “Signs of heat stroke, which is a more dangerous condition, can cause heat rash, muscle cramps, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and seizures. “Urine colour is a key indicator: clear to light straw is good, dark or gold indicates dehydration.” Dr Gerrard added that although Queenslanders were accustomed to typical warm conditions in the state, the dangers of prolonged heat with “minimal night-time relief” could often be overlooked. Among the protective measures, the public has been advised to continue to hydrate by drinking plenty of fluids and cool water, while avoiding all hot or sugary beverages, and alcohol. Those without access to home air conditioning should seek cool community spaces including shopping centres, libraries or swimming pools during the daytime, and also try physical cooldown techniques like soaking feet in cool water and wearing a wet bandana around the neck. All strenuous activity and exercise have also been advised against, but Dr Gerrard said “if it’s unavoidable”, the early morning hours before 7am is the recommended time to go. “Everybody can be at risk of heat-related illness, but infants, the elderly, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions are especially vulnerable,” he said. “Additional risk factors include working outdoors, taking certain medications, having alcohol or other drug problems, having disabilities or mobility limitations, and being physically active. “I would urge everyone to prepare, be mindful of their health, and check on loved ones and neighbours during this period.” The hours between 10am and 3pm are expected to be the hottest parts of the day.

Sky News Australia can exclusively reveal the RFS has “hazard reduced” around 60,000 hectares – roughly 20 percent - of its 300,000-hectare target at almost the half-way point of the financial year. It hoped to catch up after summer when the weather cooled in April, May and June. Additionally, Sky News has also seen a secret document which showed multiple tracks of land rated “extreme” and “high risk” were still to be hazard reduced ahead of dangerous spikes in temperature over Christmas and New Year. The list detailed more than six-thousands hectares of land in the fire prone Hawkesbury region, north - West of Sydney. One location identified as extreme appeared to have been first approved for hazard reduction eight years go only to repeatedly miss out. There is a further 2,500 hectares of bush rated as “very high” danger to the community, also still undone. The extensive damage caused by the intensity of the 2019-20 Black Summer of bushfires has also exacerbated the danger to residents living in rural areas. With the ‘crowns’ or canopies of large gum trees destroyed, the forest floor has been exposed to years of sun and rain, allowing “impenetrable” scrub to grow back, increasing fuel loads to dangerous levels. “If you double the fuel, you quadruple the intensity of the fire,” said Volunteer Fire Fighters Association President, Brian Williams. Williams predicts future blazes will be even “bigger and worse” than four years ago, unless hazard reduction practices drastically change. “Experienced firefighters are now starting to get very concerned at the dangers,” he said. “The consequences of losing a crew or more than one crew is an ever-increasing factor in our decision-making process.” The five-decade veteran showed this reporter an area of dense scrub along the Bells Line of Road in Bilpin. The major arterial road carves its way through the Hawkesbury and over the Blue Mountains linking rural towns with metropolitan Sydney. “Four years after the Gospers Mountain (mega)fire we could get an even hotter fire (here),” Williams forewarned. “This (area) would just be an inferno.” The Gospers Mountain Fire - recorded as Australia’s biggest blaze - burned for 79 days, destroyed more than one-million hectares of land and 100 plus homes. It also sparked dangerous backburns that broke containment lines multiplying the catastrophe. The VFFA President is frustrated by what he perceives to be too few hazard reduction burns. Approvals could also take two years to be signed off from authorities which wrapped local crews in “red and green tape,” he said. He blamed a “28-page bushfire environmental code” that restricted the ability of teams to implement cooler indigenous style burns which minimised dangers to the community and bush. “The rules and regulations are destroying the environment.” “For the last 20 years we have only managed to burn less than one percent of our bushfire prone lands.” It’s a situation he believed was playing out across the state. “The fuel loads are increasing … It’s only going to get worse.” The State’s Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Rob Rogers, though rejected suggestion hazard reduction clearances needed to be drastically increased. “We should be doing as much as we possibly can,” he said. “(but) It’s impossible to burn the amount you would need to cover the amount of vegetation we have in the state.” “Every time we do a hazard reduction in Sydney, we are inundated with people complaining about the (toxic) smoke. So, if we are suggesting that we need to increase that significantly, then there needs to be a general acceptance by the population of Sydney that they will be smoked out.” He didn’t dispute though the 300,000 hectare target was behind schedule and had been rolled over from previous wet years resulting in dangerous undergrowth. “There’s a massive amount of hazard reduction to do.” Commissioner Rogers also rejected the idea the service was “culpable” in the event a fire ravages an area listed for clearing but isn’t carried out in time. “It’s not just to do before the end of summer, it’s a 12-month target,” he said. “It’s about next summer and the summer after. It’s not just one particular period.” In terms of this fire season the state was “very prepared,” he said, having invested in resources and training. “We’ve been using that time since (2019) to be ready to refight that fire season again. But do it even better than we did last time.” Commissioner Rogers though conceded as Brian Williams had warned, many of those areas destroyed in 2019 were posing a bigger threat than expected. “I am genuinely concerned how much these fires are burning in areas that only like four years old.” Perhaps of equal concern for the RFS are figures that track a decline in volunteer numbers as crews age and move away from rural regions. Officially the service has slipped from 76,000 volunteers four years ago to 71,000 today. Sky News has been told local brigades often have far fewer volunteers available than claimed on their books.

In September a Federal Court judge ruled that the federal regulator wrongly approved Woodside’s Scarborough gas project before the company had adequately consulted a traditional custodian who was concerned seismic testing could harm her cultural heritage. This followed a similar Federal Court decision late last year that forced Santos to halt drilling on its $5.4bn Barossa gas development in the Northern Territory after it failed to consult elders from the Tiwi Islands. Ms O’Nell said Woodside was confident the company’s Scarborough development “will go ahead”, but that the government needed to change the law to ensure future projects weren’t put at risk. “We believe we have a pathway to get the approvals we need with the regulatory framework that's in place today, albeit with a lot more work and a lot more complexity,” she said. “The court rulings that happened late last year have created a huge amount of confusion not just for the industry and the regulator, but also for a lot of local communities. “We think a legislative fix is required and really that's about ensuring that everybody who's involved has clarity on what kind of consultation is appropriate.” The Woodside CEO said the company had a “large suite of opportunities” available and the board needed to make sure future investments “deliver value for our shareholders”. “One of the things that's an important consideration is the fiscal and regulatory framework,” she said. “We want to have confidence that when we spend money in a place that we will get the benefits over 10 or 20 years time.” Ms O’Neill added it was “fair to say that the risk in Australia has been increasing” and this created doubts about whether future projects would be approved. Asked by Business Weekend host Ross Greenwood how the environment in Australia compared to other countries the energy giant is investing in, the Woodside CEO said she had received a “very warm” reception from the Mexican government during a recent meeting. “It was a very warm visit. The Mexican President knew about our project very well… and (was) very supportive of Woodside's investment. “The President was super supportive and he encouraged us to look at other opportunities to invest in Mexico. So a really warm reception.” In contrast, Ms O’Nell said the reception she received from the Australian government “complicated” and “probably not as warm and fuzzy”. “Look, I think many in government understand that we just want to make sure that we have the right long-term support for the business,” the Woodside CEO said. “(But) the tone that set around investments today sends a message about appetite for investments tomorrow and that is something that we watch as an investor.”",skynewsau,2023-11-12 04:56:27.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.skynews.com.au/business/energy/woodside-ceo-meg-oneill-warns-regulatory-risk-could-put-jeopardise-future-investment-calls-for-legislative-fix-to-correct-recent-court-decisions/news-story/2e104b7660a9ca5f5e352787df0b23b1

Vision from locals showed dozens of trees and branches were brought down and an estimated 35,000 homes have been left without power for several hours. The Bureau of Meteorology overnight issued a major flood warning for residents near the Daintree River and a major alert for the Mossman River. It has warned of possible flooding on Thursday morning. Queensland and Fire Emergency Service Far Northern Region Commander Assistant Brad Commens said the alert, including a high tide about 10am, will see waters rise. ""People are asked to stay away from those areas (Daintree and Mossman rivers). Now is definitely not a time to go out and look around,"" he told Sky News Australia. Ex-Cyclone Jasper has already brought high total rainfalls, with 470 millimetres recorded in 24 hours at Yandill, 389mm at Daintree Village and 370mm at Myola. Sky News Australia Meteorologist Alison Osbourne on Thursday said it has not stopped raining since the storm hit the region and will continue through the day before easing. ""By later tonight the rains should continue but ease back across the coast and then focus the heavy falls inland,"" she said. It is estimated some areas could receive between 200-400mm of more rain. Crews from different department are back out on Thursday morning to survey the damage across towns and begin making repairs. Ergon Energy personnel will also begin fixing power lines to return electricity to thousands of homes, however, residents are reminded to avoid downed wires. ""There has been damage through the community, but we'll have our teams out there very early this morning to start making concrete assessments of what has actually occurred so we can assist the recovery,"" QFES Ass Comm Commens said. Overnight eight people were rescued from a home just after midnight and a further 10 residents were evacuated as crews went door-to-door in Mossman. There were also 50 calls for assistance.

fd0fe015ce9f88a5fca32d00e03a6bbc,‘Delusion’: Bowen mocks push for nuclear energy despite new poll,"Australia’s climate change and energy minister has dismissed the opposition’s push for nuclear to be part of Australia’s energy future, despite polling showing increased support for the idea.","A new Resolve poll, revealed exclusively by Sky News Australia on Sunday, found while almost half the country is in favour. The polling comes ahead of the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), where some countries – including the US, UK and France – are pushing for expanded use of nuclear. Asked about the push on Sunday, Chris Bowen said he respected other countries' plans before mocking the argument idea that nuclear power is an option for Australia. “Nuclear for Australia is a fantasy wrapped in a delusion accompanied by a pipedream. I mean, it is not the right solution for Australia,” Minister Bowen said on ABC Insiders. The climate change and energy minister said he was aware of a nuclear push at COP28 but that it was “not part of the COP negotiations in the way that has been characterised”. “I've seen some reports about the role of nuclear in the COP discussions. Those reporters might be in different conversations from the one I'm in,” Mr Bowen said. “The signature call of the COP presidency is a tripling of renewables and a doubling of energy efficiency, a call we support.” Earlier on Sunday shadow attorney-general Michaelia Cash said the government’s “ideological… renewables only” approach to reducing emissions was “completely, totally and utterly out of date”. “Australia is now being seen as an international outlier because of its ideological stance and its renewable-only approach. I mean… how embarrassing,” Senator Cash said on Sky News Australia’s Sunday Agenda. “Our friends and allies are going to be signing - for the first time ever - a communique on nuclear energy. And guess what? Under Chris Bowen, Australia is not even in the room.” Senator Cash said the opposition would be releasing its energy policy in good time before the next election, insisting that unlike the Albanese government, the Coalition would not be “beholden to a reckless ideological approach”. “We will take a sensible all of the above approach to ensuring that we do lower emissions we reach net zero, but at the same time, we keep the lights on,” the shadow attorney general said. Mr Bowen dismissed the opposition’s push for nuclear to be part of Australia’s energy future and said it was “an attempt at distraction by Australia's chief climate in-activist Peter Dutton.” Mr Bowen’s comments come despite the Resolve polling showing increased support for nuclear. The polling, commissioned by consulting firm Society Advisory, shows that when voters were asked whether ""Australia should rethink its moratorium (ban) on nuclear power to give it more flexibility to choose in the future"", 49 per cent were in favour, just 18 per cent opposed, with 33 per cent unsure. When Resolve asked the 4700 Australians who were part of the poll if they supported the use of nuclear power in Australia, 33 per cent of said yes while 24 per cent said they were opposed. A further 29 per cent said they either did ""not have a strong view and am open to the government investigating its use"", while 13 per cent were undecided.",skynewsau,2023-11-26 01:20:34.000000 UTC,australia,https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/a-fantasy-wrapped-in-a-delusion-chris-bowen-mocks-nuclear-energy-push-despite-new-poll-showing-increasing-support/news-story/2a96941f133e2c89ba9c9d03142a3ce8

Economists had been expecting spending growth of just 0.3 per cent, following months of cutting back by households struggling with soaring cost of living pressures, but unseasonably good spring weather helped shake off the downward trend. ""The warmer-than-usual start to spring lifted turnover at departments stores, household goods and clothing retailers, with more spending on hardware, gardening, and clothing items,"" said head of ABS retail statistics Ben Dorber. ""Also adding a boost to turnover in household goods retailing was the release of a new iPhone model and the introduction of the Climate Smart Energy Savers Rebate program in Queensland."" The Queensland rebate, which was designed to encourage households to upgrade appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, and dryers, contributed to a 0.5 per cent increase in the state, which was otherwise expected to be flat. Every other state and territory also saw a rise in spending over the month, led by Tasmania where consumption jumped 1.8 per cent.

However, others have warned that beyond next month, highlighting the fact that consumer spending and confidence remains at levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic. That assessment was echoed by Mr Dorber on Monday, pointing out that retail spending remained far below past levels. ""While the rise in September was the largest since January, subdued spending for most of 2023 means that underlying growth in retail turnover remains historically low,"" he said.

bb6caac8799701d9d1df5f20bf781f53,Hunger striking climate activist throws in the towel,Australia's former high commissioner to Ghana Gregory Andrews has ended his hunger strike outside Parliament House in Canberra despite no movement on the Albanese government’s fossil fuel subsidies.,"Beginning on November 1, Mr Andrews camped out on the lawn of Parliament house each day and was refusing to eat until Prime Minister Anthony Albanese agreed to commit to a list of actions to fight climate change. In addition to ceasing all fossil fuel subsidies, the activist’s demands included the complete phase out of coal and gas exports, stopping the logging of native forests, releasing the findings from the National Security Climate Risk Assessment report, and amending Australia’s Environment Protection Biodiversity Act to include climate impacts. In dramatic scenes last Friday , with few updates since on whether the strike was continuing or if the one-time ambassador was eating again. After being admitted to Canberra Hospital, Mr Andrews tweeted his “body called it quits” and thanked hospital staff for “helping me get back on my feet”. In a blog post, Mr Andrews officially threw in the towel and described the decision to end the strike and save his own life after ""losing control of his limbs"". ""I had to listen to my body when it started to give out. I was losing control of my limbs and speech, and my brain got pretty foggy,"" he wrote. ""I've stopped my #ClimateHungerStrike. But I want you to know I haven't given up on the fight for our future. There's no time left. I don't really understand the psychology of it, but the fact that our Prime Minister ignored me has made me more resolute than ever. I'm glad I saved my body for what's next."" During his hospital stay, Mr Andrews shared that several climate activists had taken over the strike outside Parliament House on a revolving basis while he recuperated. In a post on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Andrews announced the latest climate activist to “take over” his hunger strike via X, formerly known as Twitter. “Hey @AlboMP we’re not giving up on our kids or our country,” he wrote. “Xanthe has taken over on Day 20 of the #ClimateHungerStrike that I started at the beginning of this month. “Please stop selling us and the rest of Australia down the river to @WoodsideEnergy and @exxonmobil!” In an accompanying video, the fellow activist announced that Mr Andrews “started with 16 days that put him in hospital” and panned to a sign reading “Thank you Gregory”. In a second post, Mr Andrews announced plans to leave Canberra and attend an upcoming protest this weekend in Newcastle to “blockade” coal exports. The update marks the end of the controversial hunger strike that saw Mr Andrews storm out of an interview with Sky News host Andrew Bolt after an intense back-and-forth over the father-of-two’s parenting abilities. ""You've got only two weeks left to live with this stupid idea that your daughter hasn't got a future,"" Bolt declared on his program a fortnight ago. ""You're betraying her, and you'll be betraying her double if you keep going with this. But we shall see. If you do, I'll come back in two weeks to see.""

Releasing the annual Climate Change Statement in parliament on Thursday, Mr Bowen will caution that while global warming already presents “serious risks” to Australia and its neighbours, this will likely worsen as the planet becomes hotter. “Climate change could lead to mass migration, demands for peacekeeping and peace enforcement, and intra‐ and inter‐state conflict while increasing demand for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief tasks at home and abroad,” the statement reads. As a result, Mr Bowen will paint a grim picture of the demands on Australia’s national security and emergency service capability. “Dealing with climate extremes is likely to place additional stress on national co-ordination arrangements and domestic crisis management agencies, stretching Australia’s emergency capabilities that deploy domestically and internationally,” Minister Bowen will say. Amid criticism over the costs of the green energy transition, Mr Bowen will use the address to bolster the government’s case for increased intervention on the basis that national security risks to Australia will increase in severity and frequency without action. “The National Security imperative just adds to the need for strong action this decade, and reinforces the importance of our domestic transformation and international engagement,” Mr Bowen will say. “Australia will not sit on its hands, pause the transformation and expect to deploy speculative solutions in 2049 to address a climate emergency that is with us now.” The annual Climate Change Statement is also expected to project that Australia will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 42 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of the decade – just short of Labor’s 43 per cent target. While the government has brought the security risks posed by climate change into focus, it has defied calls from the crossbench and the Greens on the issue. After forming government in 2022, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese tasked the Office of National Intelligence with analysing the security implications of climate change.

Failing to do so comes with a $313 fine, increasing by $313 for every 28 days the return is overdue – up to a maximum of $1565. The deadline only applies to those planning on submitting their own return, while those with a tax agent have until May 15 next year to file. Up to two million people have yet to “self-lodge” their returns according to data provided by the ATO earlier this month. One subset of the workforce, those who are self-employed, are holding off amid high costs and lower rebates, the Sole Trader Pulse by tax service Hnry has revealed. The representative data, based on interviews with 500 sole traders, shows almost one in two self-employed workers are yet to submit their tax return despite the deadline being just days away. Hnry Australia managing director Karan Anand said 50 per cent of those surveyed who have received their assessment were reporting a lower rebate compared with previous years. “Our research shows sole traders spend an average of six hours on financial admin every week,” he said. “Add to that the pressure of tax time while forking out a large sum to potentially receive a smaller rebate following the phasing out of the Low and Middle Income Tax Offset, and it’s no wonder a large proportion are putting off submitting their return.” Mr Anand said self-employed workers are spending an average of $1,000 to prepare their tax return this year, contributing to tax time being seen as a “confusing and stressful period” for independent earners.
